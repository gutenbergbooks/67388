<p class="firstpara"><span class="smcap">If</span> Judaism, Christianity and Islam have
no little in common in spite of their deep
dogmatic differences, the spiritual content
of that common element can best be appreciated
in Jewish, Christian and Islamic
mysticism, which bears equal testimony to
that ever-deepening experience of the soul
when the spiritual worshipper, whether he
be follower of Moses or Jesus or Mohammed,
turns whole-heartedly to God. As the
Quest Series has already supplied for the
first time those interested in such matters
with a simple general introduction to Jewish
mysticism, so it now provides an easy approach
to the study of Islamic mysticism on
which in English there exists no separate
introduction. But not only have we in
the following pages all that the general
reader requires to be told at first about
Sūfism; we have also a large amount of
material that will be new even to professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[p. vi]</span>
Orientalists. Dr. Nicholson sets before us
the results of twenty years’ unremitting
labour, and that, too, with remarkable
simplicity and clarity for such a subject;
at the same time he lets the mystics mostly
speak for themselves and mainly in his own
fine versions from the original Arabic and
Persian.</p>

</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="firstpara sp2"><span class="smcap">The</span> title of this book sufficiently explains
why it is included in a Series ‘exemplifying
the adventures and labours of individual
seekers or groups of seekers in quest of
reality.’ Sūfism, the religious philosophy
of Islam, is described in the oldest extant
definition as ‘the apprehension of divine
realities,’ and Mohammedan mystics are
fond of calling themselves <i>Ahl al-Haqq</i>,
‘the followers of the Real.’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In attempting
to set forth their central doctrines from
this point of view, I shall draw to some
extent on materials which I have collected
during the last twenty years for a general
history of Islamic mysticism&mdash;a subject
so vast and many-sided that several large
volumes would be required to do it anything
like justice. Here I can only sketch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span>
in broad outline certain principles, methods,
and characteristic features of the inner
life as it has been lived by Moslems of
every class and condition from the eighth
century of our era to the present day.
Difficult are the paths which they threaded,
dark and bewildering the pathless heights
beyond; but even if we may not hope to
accompany the travellers to their journey’s
end, any information that we have gathered
concerning their religious environment and
spiritual history will help us to understand
the strange experiences of which they
write.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> <i>Al-Haqq</i> is the term generally used by Sūfīs when they
refer to God.</p>

</div>

<p>In the first place, therefore, I propose
to offer a few remarks on the origin and
historical development of Sūfism, its relation
to Islam, and its general character.
Not only are these matters interesting to
the student of comparative religion; some
knowledge of them is indispensable to any
serious student of Sūfism itself. It may
be said, truly enough, that all mystical
experiences ultimately meet in a single
point; but that point assumes widely
different aspects according to the mystic’s
religion, race, and temperament, while the
converging lines of approach admit of
almost infinite variety. Though all the
great types of mysticism have something
in common, each is marked by peculiar
characteristics resulting from the circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span>
in which it arose and flourished.
Just as the Christian type cannot be
understood without reference to Christianity,
so the Mohammedan type must be
viewed in connexion with the outward and
inward development of Islam.</p>

<p>The word ‘mystic,’ which has passed
from Greek religion into European literature,
is represented in Arabic, Persian, and
Turkish, the three chief languages of Islam,
by ‘Sūfī.’ The terms, however, are not
precisely synonymous, for ‘Sūfī’ has a
specific religious connotation, and is restricted
by usage to those mystics who
profess the Mohammedan faith. And the
Arabic word, although in course of time
it appropriated the high significance of the
Greek&mdash;lips sealed by holy mysteries, eyes
closed in visionary rapture&mdash;bore a humbler
meaning when it first gained currency
(about 800 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). Until recently its derivation
was in dispute. Most Sūfīs, flying in
the face of etymology, have derived it from
an Arabic root which conveys the notion of
‘purity’; this would make ‘Sūfī’ mean
‘one who is pure in heart’ or ‘one of the
elect.’ Some European scholars identified
it with σοφός in the sense of ‘theosophist.’
But Nöldeke, in an article written
twenty years ago, showed conclusively that
the name was derived from <i>sūf</i> (wool), and
was originally applied to those Moslem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span>
ascetics who, in imitation of Christian
hermits, clad themselves in coarse woollen
garb as a sign of penitence and renunciation
of worldly vanities.</p>

<p>The earliest Sūfīs were, in fact, ascetics
and quietists rather than mystics. An overwhelming
consciousness of sin, combined
with a dread&mdash;which it is hard for us to
realise&mdash;of Judgment Day and the torments
of Hell-fire, so vividly painted in the Koran,
drove them to seek salvation in flight from
the world. On the other hand, the Koran
warned them that salvation depended entirely
on the inscrutable will of Allah, who
guides aright the good and leads astray the
wicked. Their fate was inscribed on the
eternal tables of His providence, nothing
could alter it. Only this was sure, that if
they were destined to be saved by fasting
and praying and pious works&mdash;then they
would be saved. Such a belief ends naturally
in quietism, complete and unquestioning
submission to the divine will, an attitude
characteristic of Sūfism in its oldest form.
The mainspring of Moslem religious life
during the eighth century was fear&mdash;fear
of God, fear of Hell, fear of death, fear of
sin&mdash;but the opposite motive had already
begun to make its influence felt, and produced
in the saintly woman Rābiʿa at least
one conspicuous example of truly mystical
self-abandonment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span></p>

<p>So far, there was no great difference
between the Sūfī and the orthodox Mohammedan
zealot, except that the Sūfīs attached
extraordinary importance to certain Koranic
doctrines, and developed them at the
expense of others which many Moslems
might consider equally essential. It must
also be allowed that the ascetic movement
was inspired by Christian ideals, and contrasted
sharply with the active and pleasure-loving
spirit of Islam. In a famous sentence
the Prophet denounced monkish austerities
and bade his people devote themselves to
the holy war against unbelievers; and he
gave, as is well known, the most convincing
testimony in favour of marriage. Although
his condemnation of celibacy did not remain
without effect, the conquest of Persia,
Syria, and Egypt by his successors brought
the Moslems into contact with ideas which
profoundly modified their outlook on life
and religion. European readers of the
Koran cannot fail to be struck by its
author’s vacillation and inconsistency in
dealing with the greatest problems. He
himself was not aware of these contradictions,
nor were they a stumbling-block to
his devout followers, whose simple faith
accepted the Koran as the Word of God.
But the rift was there, and soon produced
far-reaching results.</p>

<p>Hence arose the Murjites, who set faith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span>
above works and emphasised the divine love
and goodness; the Qadarites who affirmed,
and the Jabarites who denied, that men are
responsible for their actions; the Muʿtazilites,
who built a theology on the basis of reason,
rejecting the qualities of Allah as incompatible
with His unity, and predestinarianism
as contrary to His justice; and finally
the Ashʿarites, the scholastic theologians
of Islam, who formulated the rigid metaphysical
and doctrinal system that underlies
the creed of orthodox Mohammedans at the
present time. All these speculations, influenced
as they were by Greek theology
and philosophy, reacted powerfully upon
Sūfism. Early in the third century of the
Hegira&mdash;the ninth after Christ&mdash;we find
manifest signs of the new leaven stirring
within it. Not that Sūfīs ceased to mortify
the flesh and take pride in their poverty,
but they now began to regard asceticism as
only the first stage of a long journey, the
preliminary training for a larger spiritual
life than the mere ascetic is able to conceive.
The nature of the change may be illustrated
by quoting a few sentences which have come
down to us from the mystics of this period.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Love is not to be learned from
men: it is one of God’s gifts and
comes of His grace.”</p>

<p>“None refrains from the lusts of this
world save him in whose heart there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span>
light that keeps him always busied with
the next world.”</p>

<p>“When the gnostic’s spiritual eye is
opened, his bodily eye is shut: he sees
nothing but God.”</p>

<p>“If gnosis were to take visible shape
all who looked thereon would die at the
sight of its beauty and loveliness and
goodness and grace, and every brightness
would become dark beside the
splendour thereof.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“Gnosis is nearer to silence than to
speech.”</p>

<p>“When the heart weeps because it
has lost, the spirit laughs because it has
found.”</p>

<p>“Nothing sees God and dies, even as
nothing sees God and lives, because His
life is everlasting: whoever sees it is
thereby made everlasting.”</p>

<p>“O God, I never listen to the cry of
animals or to the quivering of trees or
to the murmuring of water or to the
warbling of birds or to the rustling
wind or to the crashing thunder without
feeling them to be an evidence of
Thy unity and a proof that there is
nothing like unto Thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span></p>

<p>“O my God, I invoke Thee in public
as lords are invoked, but in private as
loved ones are invoked. Publicly I say,
‘O my God!’ but privately I say, ‘O
my Beloved!’”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Compare Plato, <cite>Phædrus</cite> (Jowett’s translation): “For
sight is the keenest of our bodily senses; though not by
that is wisdom seen; her loveliness would have been transporting
if there had been a visible image of her.”</p>

</div>

<p>These ideas&mdash;Light, Knowledge, and Love&mdash;form,
as it were, the keynotes of the new
Sūfism, and in the following chapters I shall
endeavour to show how they were developed.
Ultimately they rest upon a pantheistic
faith which deposed the One transcendent
God of Islam and worshipped in His stead
One Real Being who dwells and works
everywhere, and whose throne is not less,
but more, in the human heart than in the
heaven of heavens. Before going further, it
will be convenient to answer a question
which the reader may have asked himself&mdash;Whence
did the Moslems of the ninth century
derive this doctrine?</p>

<p>Modern research has proved that the
origin of Sūfism cannot be traced back to
a single definite cause, and has thereby
discredited the sweeping generalisations
which represent it, for instance, as a reaction
of the Aryan mind against a conquering
Semitic religion, and as the product, essentially,
of Indian or Persian thought. Statements
of this kind, even when they are
partially true, ignore the principle that
in order to establish an historical connexion
between A and B, it is not enough to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span>
forward evidence of their likeness to one
another, without showing at the same time
(1) that the actual relation of B to A was
such as to render the assumed filiation
possible, and (2) that the possible hypothesis
fits in with all the ascertained and relevant
facts. Now, the theories which I have
mentioned do not satisfy these conditions.
If Sūfism was nothing but a revolt of the
Aryan spirit, how are we to explain the
undoubted fact that some of the leading
pioneers of Mohammedan mysticism were
natives of Syria and Egypt, and Arabs by
race? Similarly, the advocates of a Buddhistic
or Vedāntic origin forget that the
main current of Indian influence upon
Islamic civilisation belongs to a later epoch,
whereas Moslem theology, philosophy, and
science put forth their first luxuriant shoots
on a soil that was saturated with Hellenistic
culture. The truth is that Sūfism is a
complex thing, and therefore no simple
answer can be given to the question how
it originated. We shall have gone far,
however, towards answering that question
when we have distinguished the various
movements and forces which moulded
Sūfism, and determined what direction it
should take in the early stages of its
growth.</p>

<p>Let us first consider the most important
external, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> non-Islamic, influences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span></p>


<div class="section">
<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Christianity</span></h3>
</div>

<p>It is obvious that the ascetic and quietistic
tendencies to which I have referred were in
harmony with Christian theory and drew
nourishment therefrom. Many Gospel texts
and apocryphal sayings of Jesus are cited
in the oldest Sūfī biographies, and the
Christian anchorite (<i>rāhib</i>) often appears in
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of a teacher giving instruction and
advice to wandering Moslem ascetics. We
have seen that the woollen dress, from which
the name ‘Sūfī’ is derived, is of Christian
origin: vows of silence, litanies (<i>dhikr</i>), and
other ascetic practices may be traced to the
same source. As regards the doctrine of
divine love, the following extracts speak for
themselves:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Jesus passed by three men. Their
bodies were lean and their faces pale.
He asked them, saying, ‘What hath
brought you to this plight?’ They
answered, ‘Fear of the Fire.’ Jesus
said, ‘Ye fear a thing created, and it
behoves God that He should save those
who fear.’ Then he left them and
passed by three others, whose faces
were paler and their bodies leaner, and
asked them, saying, ‘What hath brought
you to this plight?’ They answered,
‘Longing for Paradise.’ He said, ‘Ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>
desire a thing created, and it behoves
God that He should give you that
which ye hope for.’ Then he went on
and passed by three others of exceeding
paleness and leanness, so that their
faces were as mirrors of light, and he
said, ‘What hath brought you to this?’
They answered, ‘Our love of God.’
Jesus said, ‘Ye are the nearest to Him,
ye are the nearest to Him.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The Syrian mystic, Ahmad ibn al-Hawārī,
once asked a Christian hermit:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘What is the strongest command
that ye find in your Scriptures?’ The
hermit replied: ‘We find none stronger
than this: “Love thy Creator with
all thy power and might.”’”</p>
</div>

<p>Another hermit was asked by some Moslem
ascetics:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘When is a man most persevering
in devotion?’ ‘When love takes possession
of his heart,’ was the reply; ‘for
then he hath no joy or pleasure but in
continual devotion.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The influence of Christianity through its
hermits, monks, and heretical sects (<i><abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr></i> the
Messalians or Euchitæ) was twofold: ascetic
and mystical. Oriental Christian mysticism,
however, contained a Pagan element: it
had long ago absorbed the ideas and adopted
the language of Plotinus and the Neoplatonic
school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span></p>


<div class="section">
<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Neoplatonism</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Aristotle, not Plato, is the dominant figure
in Moslem philosophy, and few Mohammedans
are familiar with the name of
Plotinus, who was more commonly called
‘the Greek Master’ (<i>al-Sheykh al-Yaunānī</i>).
But since the Arabs gained their first knowledge
of Aristotle from his Neoplatonist
commentators, the system with which they
became imbued was that of Porphyry and
Proclus. Thus the so-called <cite>Theology of
Aristotle</cite>, of which an Arabic version appeared
in the ninth century, is actually a
manual of Neoplatonism.</p>

<p>Another work of this school deserves particular
notice: I mean the writings falsely
attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite, the
convert of St. Paul. The pseudo-Dionysius&mdash;he
may have been a Syrian monk&mdash;names
as his teacher a certain Hierotheus, whom
Frothingham has identified with Stephen
Bar Sudaili, a prominent Syrian gnostic and
a contemporary of Jacob of Sarūj (451-521
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). Dionysius quotes some fragments of
erotic hymns by this Stephen, and a complete
work, the <cite>Book of Hierotheus on the Hidden
Mysteries of the Divinity</cite>, has come down to us
in a unique manuscript which is now in the
British Museum. The Dionysian writings,
turned into Latin by John Scotus Erigena,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span>
founded medieval Christian mysticism in
Western Europe. Their influence in the East
was hardly less vital. They were translated
from Greek into Syriac almost immediately
on their appearance, and their doctrine was
vigorously propagated by commentaries in
the same tongue. “About 850 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> Dionysius
was known from the Tigris to the
Atlantic.”</p>

<p>Besides literary tradition, there were other
channels by which the doctrines of emanation,
illumination, gnosis, and ecstasy were transmitted,
but enough has been said to convince
the reader that Greek mystical ideas were in
the air and easily accessible to the Moslem
inhabitants of Western Asia and Egypt,
where the Sūfī theosophy first took shape.
One of those who bore the chief part in its
development, Dhu ’l-Nūn the Egyptian, is
described as a philosopher and alchemist&mdash;in
other words, a student of Hellenistic science.
When it is added that much of his speculation
agrees with what we find, for example,
in the writings of Dionysius, we are drawn
irresistibly to the conclusion (which, as I
have pointed out, is highly probable on
general grounds) that Neoplatonism poured
into Islam a large tincture of the same
mystical element in which Christianity was
already steeped.</p>

<p>Though little direct evidence is available,
the conspicuous place occupied by the theory
of gnosis in early Sūfī speculation suggests
contact with Christian Gnosticism, and it is
worth noting that the parents of Maʿrūf al-Karkhī,
whose definition of Sūfism, as ‘the
apprehension of divine realities’ was quoted
on the first page of <a href="#INTRODUCTION">this Introduction</a>, are
said to have been Sābians, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> Mandæans,
dwelling in the Babylonian fenland between
Basra and Wāsit. Other Moslem saints had
learned ‘the mystery of the Great Name.’
It was communicated to Ibrāhīm ibn Adham
by a man whom he met while travelling in
the desert, and as soon as he pronounced it he
saw the prophet Khadir (Elias). The ancient
Sūfīs borrowed from the Manichæans the
term <i>siddīq</i>, which they apply to their own
spiritual adepts, and a later school, returning
to the dualism of Mānī, held the view
that the diversity of phenomena arises
from the admixture of light and darkness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The ideal of human action is freedom
from the taint of darkness; and
the freedom of light from darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span>

</div>

<p>The following version of the doctrine of
the seventy thousand veils as explained by a
modern Rifāʿī dervish shows clear traces of
Gnosticism and is so interesting that I cannot
refrain from quoting it here:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Seventy Thousand Veils separate
Allah, the One Reality, from the world
of matter and of sense. And every
soul passes before his birth through
these seventy thousand. The inner half
of these are veils of light: the outer
half, veils of darkness. For every one
of the veils of light passed through, in
this journey towards birth, the soul
puts <em>off</em> a divine quality: and for every
one of the dark veils, it puts <em>on</em> an
earthly quality. Thus the child is born
<em>weeping</em>, for the soul knows its separation
from Allah, the One Reality. And
when the child cries in its sleep, it is
because the soul remembers something
of what it has lost. Otherwise, the
passage through the veils has brought
with it forgetfulness (<i>nisyān</i>): and for
this reason man is called <i>insān</i>. He is
now, as it were, in prison in his body,
separated by these thick curtains from
Allah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span></p>

<p>“But the whole purpose of Sūfism,
the Way of the dervish, is to give him
an escape from this prison, an apocalypse
of the Seventy Thousand Veils,
a recovery of the original unity with
The One, <em>while still in this body</em>. The
body is not to be put off; it is to be
refined and made spiritual&mdash;a help and
not a hindrance to the spirit. It is
like a metal that has to be refined by
fire and transmuted. And the sheikh
tells the aspirant that he has the secret
of this transmutation. ‘We shall throw
you into the fire of Spiritual Passion,’ he
says, ‘and you will emerge refined.’”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Buddhism</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Before the Mohammedan conquest of
India in the eleventh century, the teaching
of Buddha exerted considerable influence
in Eastern Persia and Transoxania. We
hear of flourishing Buddhist monasteries in
Balkh, the metropolis of ancient Bactria,
a city famous for the number of Sūfīs who
resided in it. Professor Goldziher has called
attention to the significant circumstance
that the Sūfī ascetic, Ibrāhīm ibn Adham,
appears in Moslem legend as a prince of
Balkh who abandoned his throne and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span>
became a wandering dervish&mdash;the story of
Buddha over again. The Sūfīs learned the
use of rosaries from Buddhist monks, and,
without entering into details, it may be
safely asserted that the method of Sūfism,
so far as it is one of ethical self-culture,
ascetic meditation, and intellectual abstraction,
owes a good deal to Buddhism. But
the features which the two systems have in
common only accentuate the fundamental
difference between them. In spirit they
are poles apart. The Buddhist moralises
himself, the Sūfī becomes moral only through
knowing and loving God.</p>

<p>The Sūfī conception of the passing-away
(<i>fanā</i>) of individual self in Universal Being
is certainly, I think, of Indian origin. Its
first great exponent was the Persian mystic,
Bāyazīd of Bistām, who may have received
it from his teacher, Abū ʿAlī of Sind (Scinde).
Here are some of his sayings:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Creatures are subject to changing
‘states,’ but the gnostic has no ‘state,’
because his vestiges are effaced and his
essence annihilated by the essence of
another, and his traces are lost in
another’s traces.”</p>

<p>“Thirty years the high God was my
mirror, now I am my own mirror,” <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>
according to the explanation given by
his biographer, “that which I was I am
no more, for ‘I’ and ‘God’ is a denial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span>
of the unity of God. Since I am no
more, the high God is His own mirror.”</p>

<p>“I went from God to God, until they
cried from me in me, ‘O Thou I!’”</p>
</div>

<p class="sp2">This, it will be observed, is not Buddhism,
but the pantheism of the Vedānta. We
cannot identify <i>fanā</i> with Nirvāṇa unconditionally.
Both terms imply the passing-away
of individuality, but while Nirvāṇa
is purely negative, <i>fanā</i> is accompanied by
<i>baqā</i>, everlasting life in God. The rapture
of the Sūfī who has lost himself in ecstatic
contemplation of the divine beauty is
entirely opposed to the passionless intellectual
serenity of the Arahat. I emphasise
this contrast because, in my opinion, the
influence of Buddhism on Mohammedan
thought has been exaggerated. Much is
attributed to Buddhism that is Indian
rather than specifically Buddhistic: the <i>fanā</i>
theory of the Sūfīs is a case in point.
Ordinary Moslems held the followers of
Buddha in abhorrence, regarding them as
idolaters, and were not likely to seek personal
intercourse with them. On the other
hand, for nearly a thousand years before
the Mohammedan conquest, Buddhism had
been powerful in Bactria and Eastern Persia
generally: it must, therefore, have affected
the development of Sūfism in these regions.</p>

<p>While <i>fanā</i> in its pantheistic form is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span>
radically different from Nirvāṇa, the terms
coincide so closely in other ways that we
cannot regard them as being altogether
unconnected. <i>Fanā</i> has an ethical aspect:
it involves the extinction of all passions and
desires. The passing-away of evil qualities
and of the evil actions which they produce
is said to be brought about by the continuance
of the corresponding good qualities
and actions. Compare this with the definition
of Nirvāṇa given by Professor Rhys Davids:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The extinction of that sinful, grasping
condition of mind and heart, which
would otherwise, according to the great
mystery of Karma, be the cause of
renewed individual existence. That
extinction is to be brought about by,
and runs parallel with, the growth of
the opposite condition of mind and
heart; and it is complete when that
opposite condition is reached.”</p>
</div>

<p>Apart from the doctrine of Karma, which
is alien to Sūfism, these definitions of <i>fanā</i>
(viewed as a moral state) and Nirvāṇa
agree almost word for word. It would be
out of place to pursue the comparison
further, but I think we may conclude that
the Sūfī theory of <i>fanā</i> was influenced to
some extent by Buddhism as well as by
Perso-Indian pantheism.</p>

<p>The receptivity of Islam to foreign ideas
has been recognised by every unbiassed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span>
inquirer, and the history of Sūfism is only
a single instance of the general rule. But
this fact should not lead us to seek in
such ideas an explanation of the whole
question which I am now discussing, or to
identify Sūfism itself with the extraneous
ingredients which it absorbed and assimilated
in the course of its development.
Even if Islam had been miraculously shut
off from contact with foreign religions and
philosophies, some form of mysticism would
have arisen within it, for the seeds were
already there. Of course, we cannot isolate
the internal forces working in this direction,
since they were subject to the law of spiritual
gravitation. The powerful currents of
thought discharged through the Mohammedan
world by the great non-Islamic
systems above mentioned gave a stimulus
to various tendencies within Islam which
affected Sūfism either positively or negatively.
As we have seen, its oldest type is an
ascetic revolt against luxury and worldliness;
later on, the prevailing rationalism
and scepticism provoked counter-movements
towards intuitive knowledge and
emotional faith, and also an orthodox reaction
which in its turn drove many earnest
Moslems into the ranks of the mystics.</p>

<p>How, it may be asked, could a religion
founded on the simple and austere monotheism
of Mohammed tolerate these new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span>
doctrines, much less make terms with them?
It would seem impossible to reconcile the
transcendent personality of Allah with an
immanent Reality which is the very life
and soul of the universe. Yet Islam has
accepted Sūfism. The Sūfīs, instead of being
excommunicated, are securely established
in the Mohammedan church, and the <cite>Legend
of the Moslem Saints</cite> records the wildest
excesses of Oriental pantheism.</p>

<p>Let us return for a moment to the Koran,
that infallible touchstone by which every
Mohammedan theory and practice must be
proved. Are any germs of mysticism to
be found there? The Koran, as I have
said, starts with the notion of Allah, the
One, Eternal, and Almighty God, far above
human feelings and aspirations&mdash;the Lord
of His slaves, not the Father of His children;
a judge meting out stern justice to sinners,
and extending His mercy only to those who
avert His wrath by repentance, humility,
and unceasing works of devotion; a God
of fear rather than of love. This is one
side, and certainly the most prominent side,
of Mohammed’s teaching; but while he
set an impassable gulf between the world
and Allah, his deeper instinct craved a
direct revelation from God to the soul.
There are no contradictions in the logic of
feeling. Mohammed, who had in him something
of the mystic, felt God both as far and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span>
near, both as transcendent and immanent.
In the latter aspect, Allah is the light
of the heavens and the earth, a Being who
works in the world and in the soul of man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If My servants ask thee about Me,
lo, I am near” (Kor. <span class="bold">2</span>. 182); “We
(God) are nearer to him than his own
neck-vein” (<span class="bold">50.</span> 15); “And in the
earth are signs to those of real faith,
and in yourselves. What! do ye not
see?” (<span class="bold">51.</span> 20-21).</p>
</div>

<p>It was a long time ere they saw. The
Moslem consciousness, haunted by terrible
visions of the wrath to come, slowly and
painfully awoke to the significance of those
liberating ideas.</p>

<p>The verses which I have quoted do not
stand alone, and however unfavourable to
mysticism the Koran as a whole may be,
I cannot assent to the view that it supplies
no basis for a mystical interpretation of
Islam. This was worked out in detail by
the Sūfīs, who dealt with the Koran in very
much the same way as Philo treated the
Pentateuch. But they would not have
succeeded so thoroughly in bringing over
the mass of religious Moslems to their side,
unless the champions of orthodoxy had set
about constructing a system of scholastic
philosophy that reduced the divine nature
to a purely formal, changeless, and absolute
unity, a bare will devoid of all affections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span>
and emotions, a tremendous and incalculable
power with which no human creature could
have any communion or personal intercourse
whatsoever. That is the God of
Mohammedan theology. That was the
alternative to Sūfism. Therefore, “all
thinking, religious Moslems are mystics,”
as Professor D. B. Macdonald, one of our
best authorities on the subject, has remarked.
And he adds: “All, too, are pantheists, but
some do not know it.”</p>

<p>The relation of individual Sūfīs to Islam
varies from more or less entire conformity
to a merely nominal profession of belief in
Allah and His Prophet. While the Koran
and the Traditions are generally acknowledged
to be the unalterable standard of
religious truth, this acknowledgment does
not include the recognition of any external
authority which shall decide what is orthodox
and what is heretical. Creeds and catechisms
count for nothing in the Sūfī’s
estimation. Why should he concern himself
with these when he possesses a doctrine
derived immediately from God? As he
reads the Koran with studious meditation
and rapt attention, lo, the hidden meanings&mdash;infinite,
inexhaustible&mdash;of the Holy Word
flash upon his inward eye. This is what
the Sūfīs call <i>istinbāt</i>, a sort of intuitive
deduction; the mysterious inflow of divinely
revealed knowledge into hearts made pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span>
by repentance and filled with the thought
of God, and the outflow of that knowledge
upon the interpreting tongue. Naturally,
the doctrines elicited by means of <i>istinbāt</i>
do not agree very well either with Mohammedan
theology or with each other, but
the discord is easily explained. Theologians,
who interpret the letter, cannot be expected
to reach the same conclusions as mystics,
who interpret the spirit; and if both
classes differ amongst themselves, that is
a merciful dispensation of divine wisdom,
since theological controversy serves to extinguish
religious error, while the variety
of mystical truth corresponds to the
manifold degrees and modes of mystical
experience.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#Chapter_3" title="Go to Chapter 3">chapter on the gnosis</a> I shall enter
more fully into the attitude of the Sūfīs
towards positive religion. It is only a
rough-and-ready account of the matter to
say that many of them have been good
Moslems, many scarcely Moslems at all,
and a third party, perhaps the largest,
Moslems after a fashion. During the early
Middle Ages Islam was a growing organism,
and gradually became transformed under
the influence of diverse movements, of
which Sūfism itself was one. Mohammedan
orthodoxy in its present shape owes much
to Ghazālī, and Ghazālī was a Sūfī. Through
his work and example the Sūfistic interpretation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span>
of Islam has in no small measure
been harmonised with the rival claims of
reason and tradition, but just because of
this he is less valuable than mystics of a
purer type to the student who wishes to
know what Sūfism essentially is.</p>

<p>Although the numerous definitions of
Sūfism which occur in Arabic and Persian
books on the subject are historically interesting,
their chief importance lies in showing
that Sūfism is undefinable. Jalāluddīn
Rūmī in his <i>Masnavī</i> tells a story about
an elephant which some Hindoos were
exhibiting in a dark room. Many people
gathered to see it, but, as the place was too
dark to permit them to see the elephant,
they all felt it with their hands, to gain
an idea of what it was like. One felt its
trunk, and said that the animal resembled a
water-pipe; another felt its ear, and said
it must be a large fan; another its leg,
and thought it must be a pillar; another
felt its back, and declared that the beast
must be like an immense throne. So it is
with those who define Sūfism: they can only
attempt to express what they themselves have
felt, and there is no conceivable formula
that will comprise every shade of personal and
intimate religious feeling. Since, however,
these definitions illustrate with convenient
brevity certain aspects and characteristics
of Sūfism, a few specimens may be given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sūfism is this: that actions should
be passing over the Sūfī (<i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> being done
upon him) which are known to God only,
and that he should always be with God
in a way that is known to God only.”</p>

<p>“Sūfism is wholly self-discipline.”</p>

<p>“Sūfism is, to possess nothing and to
be possessed by nothing.”</p>

<p>“Sūfism is not a system composed
of rules or sciences but a moral disposition;
<i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> if it were a rule, it could
be made one’s own by strenuous exertion,
and if it were a science, it could
be acquired by instruction; but on the
contrary it is a disposition, according
to the saying, ‘Form yourselves on the
moral nature of God’; and the moral
nature of God cannot be attained either
by means of rules or by means of
sciences.”</p>

<p>“Sūfism is freedom and generosity
and absence of self-constraint.”</p>

<p>“It is this: that God should make
thee die to thyself and should make
thee live in Him.”</p>

<p>“To behold the imperfection of the
phenomenal world, nay, to close the
eye to everything imperfect in contemplation
of Him who is remote from
all imperfection&mdash;that is Sūfism.”</p>

<p>“Sūfism is control of the faculties
and observance of the breaths.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span></p>

<p>“It is Sūfism to put away what thou
hast in thy head, to give what thou hast
in thy hand, and not to recoil from
whatsoever befalls thee.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reader will perceive that Sūfism is
a word uniting many divergent meanings,
and that in sketching its main features
one is obliged to make a sort of composite
portrait, which does not represent any particular
type exclusively. The Sūfīs are not
a sect, they have no dogmatic system, the
<i>tarīqas</i> or paths by which they seek God
“are in number as the souls of men” and
vary infinitely, though a family likeness may
be traced in them all. Descriptions of such
a Protean phenomenon must differ widely
from one another, and the impression produced
in each case will depend on the choice
of materials and the prominence given to
this or that aspect of the many-sided whole.
Now, the essence of Sūfism is best displayed
in its extreme type, which is pantheistic and
speculative rather than ascetic or devotional.
This type, therefore, I have purposely placed
in the foreground. The advantage of limiting
the field is obvious enough, but entails
some loss of proportion. In order to form
a fair judgment of Mohammedan mysticism,
the following chapters should be supplemented
by a companion picture drawn
especially from those moderate types which,
for want of space, I have unduly neglected.</p>

</div>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="smcap">Mystics</span> of every race and creed have
described the progress of the spiritual life as
a journey or a pilgrimage. Other symbols
have been used for the same purpose, but
this one appears to be almost universal in
its range. The Sūfī who sets out to seek
God calls himself a ‘traveller’ (<i>sālik</i>); he
advances by slow ‘stages’ (<i>maqāmāt</i>) along
a ‘path’ (<i>tarīqat</i>) to the goal of union with
Reality (<i>fanā fi ’l-Haqq</i>). Should he venture
to make a map of this interior ascent,
it will not correspond exactly with any of
those made by previous explorers. Such
maps or scales of perfection were elaborated
by Sūfī teachers at an early period, and the
unlucky Moslem habit of systematising has
produced an enormous aftercrop. The
‘path’ expounded by the author of the <cite>Kitāb
al-Lumaʿ</cite>, perhaps the oldest comprehensive
treatise on Sūfism that we now possess,
consists of the following seven ‘stages,’ each
of which (except the first member of the series)
is the result of the ‘stages’ immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span>
preceding it&mdash;(1) Repentance, (2) abstinence,
(3) renunciation, (4) poverty, (5)
patience, (6) trust in God, (7) satisfaction.
The ‘stages’ constitute the <em>ascetic and
ethical</em> discipline of the Sūfī, and must be
carefully distinguished from the so-called
‘states’ (<i>ahwāl</i>, plural of <i>hāl</i>), which form
a similar <em>psychological</em> chain. The writer
whom I have just quoted enumerates ten
‘states’&mdash;Meditation, nearness to God, love,
fear, hope, longing, intimacy, tranquillity,
contemplation, and certainty. While the
‘stages’ can be acquired and mastered by
one’s own efforts, the ‘states’ are spiritual
feelings and dispositions over which a man
has no control:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They descend from God into his
heart, without his being able to repel
them when they come or to retain
them when they go.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Sūfī’s ‘path’ is not finished until he
has traversed all the ‘stages,’ making himself
perfect in every one of them before
advancing to the next, and has also experienced
whatever ‘states’ it pleases God to
bestow upon him. Then, and only then, is
he permanently raised to the higher planes
of consciousness which Sūfīs call ‘the
Gnosis’ (<i>maʿrifat</i>) and ‘the Truth’ (<i>haqīqat</i>),
where the ‘seeker’ (<i>tālib</i>) becomes the
‘knower’ or ‘gnostic’ (<i>ʿārif</i>), and realises
that knowledge, knower, and known are One.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span></p>

<p>Having sketched, as briefly as possible,
the external framework of the method by
which the Sūfī approaches his goal, I shall
now try to give some account of its inner
workings. The present chapter deals with
the first portion of the threefold journey&mdash;the
Path, the Gnosis, and the Truth&mdash;by
which the quest of Reality is often symbolised.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote">Repentance.</div>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">The first place in every list of ‘stages’ is
occupied by repentance (<i>tawbat</i>). This is
the Moslem term for ‘conversion,’ and marks
the beginning of a new life. In the biographies
of eminent Sūfīs the dreams, visions,
auditions, and other experiences which
caused them to enter on the Path are usually
related. Trivial as they may seem, these
records have a psychological basis, and, if
authentic, would be worth studying in
detail. Repentance is described as the
awakening of the soul from the
slumber of heedlessness, so that
the sinner becomes aware of his evil ways
and feels contrition for past disobedience.
He is not truly penitent, however, unless
(1) he at once abandons the sin or sins of
which he is conscious, and (2) firmly resolves
that he will never return to these sins
in the future. It he should fail to keep his
vow, he must again turn to God, whose
mercy is infinite. A certain well-known
Sūfī repented seventy times and fell back
into sin seventy times before he made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span>
lasting repentance. The convert must also,
as far as lies in his power, satisfy all those
whom he has injured. Many examples of
such restitution might be culled from the
<cite>Legend of the Moslem Saints</cite>.</p>

<p>According to the high mystical theory,
repentance is purely an act of divine grace,
coming from God to man, not from man to
God. Some one said to Rābiʿa:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have committed many sins; if
I turn in penitence towards God, will
He turn in mercy towards me?”
“Nay,” she replied, “but if He shall
turn towards thee, thou wilt turn
towards Him.”</p>
</div>

<p>The question whether sins ought to be
remembered after repentance or forgotten
illustrates a fundamental point in Sūfī
ethics: I mean the difference between what
is taught to novices and disciples and what
is held as an esoteric doctrine by adepts.
Any Mohammedan director of souls would
tell his pupils that to think humbly and
remorsefully of one’s sins is a sovereign
remedy against spiritual pride, but he himself
might very well believe that real repentance
consists in forgetting everything
except God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The penitent,” says Hujwīrī, “is
a lover of God, and the lover of God
is in contemplation of God: in contemplation
it is wrong to remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>
sin, for recollection of sin is a veil
between God and the contemplative.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sin appertains to self-existence, which
itself is the greatest of all sins. To forget
sin is to forget self.</p>

<p>This is only one application of a principle
which, as I have said, runs through the
whole ethical system of Sūfism and will be
more fully explained in a subsequent chapter.
Its dangers are evident, but we must in
fairness allow that the same theory of conduct
may not be equally suitable to those
who have made themselves perfect in moral
discipline and to those who are still striving
after perfection.</p>

<p>Over the gate of repentance it is written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="sidenote">The Sheykh.</div>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">The convert now begins what is called by
Christian mystics the Purgative Way. If
he follows the general rule, he will take a
director (Sheykh, Pīr, Murshid), <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> a holy
man of ripe experience and profound
knowledge, whose least
word is absolute law to his disciples. A
‘seeker’ who attempts to traverse the
‘Path’ without assistance receives little
sympathy. Of such a one it is said that ‘his
guide is Satan,’ and he is likened to a tree
that for want of the gardener’s care brings
forth ‘none or bitter fruit.’ Speaking of
the Sūfī Sheykhs, Hujwīrī says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When a novice joins them, with
the purpose of renouncing the world,
they subject him to spiritual discipline
for the space of three years. If he
fulfil the requirements of this discipline,
well and good; otherwise, they declare
that he cannot be admitted to the
‘Path.’ The first year is devoted to
service of the people, the second year
to service of God, and the third year to
watching over his own heart. He can
serve the people, only when he places
himself in the rank of servants and all
others in the rank of masters, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> he
must regard all, without exception, as
being better than himself, and must
deem it his duty to serve all alike. And
he can serve God, only when he cuts
off all his selfish interests relating either
to the present or to the future life, and
worships God for God’s sake alone,
inasmuch as whoever worships God for
any thing’s sake worships himself, not
God. And he can watch over his heart,
only when his thoughts are collected
and every care is dismissed, so that in
communion with God he guards his
heart from the assaults of heedlessness.
When these qualifications are
possessed by the novice, he may
wear the <i>muraqqaʿat</i> (the patched
frock worn by dervishes) as a true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span>
mystic, not merely as an imitator of
others.”</p>
</div>

<p>Shiblī was a pupil of the famous theosophist
Junayd of Baghdād. On his conversion,
he came to Junayd, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They tell me that you possess the
pearl of divine knowledge: either give
it me or sell it.” Junayd answered:
“I cannot sell it, for you have not the
price thereof; and if I give it you, you
will have gained it cheaply. You do
not know its value. Cast yourself headlong,
like me, into this ocean, in order
that you may win the pearl by waiting
patiently.”</p>
</div>

<p>Shiblī asked what he must do.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Go,” said Junayd, “and sell
sulphur.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the end of a year he said to Shiblī:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This trading makes you well known.
Become a dervish and occupy yourself
solely with begging.”</p>
</div>

<p>During a whole year Shiblī wandered
through the streets of Baghdād, begging of
the passers-by, but no one heeded him.
Then he returned to Junayd, who exclaimed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“See now! You are nothing in
people’s eyes. Never set your mind on
them or take any account of them at
all. For some time” (he continued)
“you were a chamberlain and acted as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span>
governor of a province. Go to that
country and ask pardon of all those
whom you have wronged.”</p>
</div>

<p>Shiblī obeyed and spent four years in
going from door to door, until he had obtained
an acquittance from every person
except one, whom he failed to trace. On
his return, Junayd said to him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You still have some regard to
reputation. Go and be a beggar for
one year more.”</p>
</div>

<p>Every day Shiblī used to bring the alms
that were given him to Junayd, who bestowed
them on the poor and kept Shiblī
without food until the next morning. When
a year had passed in this way, Junayd accepted
him as one of his disciples on condition
that he should perform the duties of a
servant to the others. After a year’s service,
Junayd asked him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What think you of yourself now?”
Shiblī replied: “I deem myself the
meanest of God’s creatures.” “Now,”
said the master, “your faith is firm.”</p>
</div>

<p>I need not dwell on the details of this
training&mdash;the fasts and vigils, the vows of
silence, the long days and nights of solitary
meditation, all the weapons and tactics, in
short, of that battle against one’s self which
the Prophet declared to be more painful and
meritorious than the Holy War. On the
other hand, my readers will expect me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span>
describe in a general way the characteristic
theories and practices for which the ‘Path’
is a convenient designation. These may be
treated under the following heads: Poverty,
Mortification, Trust in God, and Recollection.
Whereas poverty is negative in nature, involving
detachment from all that is worldly
and unreal, the three remaining terms denote
the positive counterpart of that process,
namely, the ethical discipline by which
the soul is brought into harmonious relations
with Reality.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote">Poverty.</div>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">The fatalistic spirit which brooded darkly
over the childhood of Islam&mdash;the feeling
that all human actions are determined by
an unseen Power, and in themselves are
worthless and vain&mdash;caused renunciation to
become the watchword of early Moslem
asceticism. Every true believer is bound
to abstain from unlawful pleasures, but the
ascetic acquires merit by abstaining from
those which are lawful. At first, renunciation
was understood almost exclusively in a
material sense. To have as few
worldly goods as possible seemed
the surest means of gaining salvation.
Dāwud al-Tāʾī owned nothing except a mat
of rushes, a brick which he used as a pillow,
and a leathern vessel which served him
for drinking and washing. A certain man
dreamed that he saw Mālik ibn Dīnār and
Mohammed ibn Wāsiʿ being led into Paradise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span>
and that Mālik was admitted before
his companion. He cried out in astonishment,
for he thought Mohammed ibn Wāsiʿ
had a superior claim to the honour. “Yes,”
came the answer, “but Mohammed ibn Wāsiʿ
possessed two shirts, and Mālik only one.
That is the reason why Mālik is preferred.”</p>

<p>The Sūfī ideal of poverty goes far beyond
this. True poverty is not merely lack of
wealth, but lack of desire for wealth: the
empty heart as well as the empty hand.
The ‘poor man’ (<i>faqīr</i>) and the ‘mendicant’
(<i>dervīsh</i>) are names by which the
Mohammedan mystic is proud to be known,
because they imply that he is stripped of
every thought or wish that would divert his
mind from God. “To be severed entirely
from both the present life and the future
life, and to want nothing besides the Lord
of the present life and the future life&mdash;that
is to be truly poor.” Such a <i>faqīr</i> is denuded
of individual existence, so that he
does not attribute to himself any action,
feeling, or quality. He may even be rich,
in the common meaning of the word, though
spiritually he is the poorest of the poor;
for, sometimes, God endows His saints with
an outward show of wealth and worldliness
in order to hide them from the profane.</p>

<p>No one familiar with the mystical writers
will need to be informed that their terminology
is ambiguous, and that the same word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span>
frequently covers a group, if not a multitude,
of significations diverging more or less
widely according to the aspect from which
it is viewed. Hence the confusion that
is apparent in Sūfī text-books. When
‘poverty,’ for example, is explained by one
interpreter as a transcendental theory and
by another as a practical rule of religious
life, the meanings cannot coincide. Regarded
from the latter standpoint, poverty
is only the beginning of Sūfism. <i>Faqīrs</i>,
Jāmī says, renounce all worldly things for
the sake of pleasing God. They are urged
to this sacrifice by one of three motives:
(<em>a</em>) Hope of an easy reckoning on the Day
of Judgment, or fear of being punished;
(<em>b</em>) desire of Paradise; (<em>c</em>) longing for
spiritual peace and inward composure.
Thus, inasmuch as they are not disinterested
but seek to benefit themselves, they rank
below the Sūfī, who has no will of his own
and depends absolutely on the will of God.
It is the absence of ‘self’ that distinguishes
the Sūfī from the <i>faqīr</i>.</p>

<p>Here are some maxims for dervishes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Do not beg unless you are starving.
The Caliph Omar flogged a man who
begged after having satisfied his hunger.
When compelled to beg, do not accept
more than you need.”</p>

<p>“Be good-natured and uncomplaining
and thank God for your poverty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span></p>

<p>“Do not flatter the rich for giving,
nor blame them for withholding.”</p>

<p>“Dread the loss of poverty more than
the rich man dreads the loss of wealth.”</p>

<p>“Take what is voluntarily offered:
it is the daily bread which God sends
to you: do not refuse God’s gift.”</p>

<p>“Let no thought of the morrow enter
your mind, else you will incur everlasting
perdition.”</p>

<p>“Do not make God a springe to
catch alms.”</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote">The <i>nafs</i>.</div>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">The Sūfī teachers gradually built up a
system of asceticism and moral culture
which is founded on the fact that there is in
man an element of evil&mdash;the lower or appetitive
soul. This evil self, the seat of
passion and lust, is called <i>nafs</i>;
it may be considered broadly
equivalent to ‘the flesh,’ and with its
allies, the world and the devil, it constitutes
the great obstacle to the attainment of
union with God. The Prophet said: “Thy
worst enemy is thy <i>nafs</i>, which is between
thy two sides.” I do not intend to discuss
the various opinions as to its nature, but
the proof of its materiality is too curious
to be omitted. Mohammed ibn ʿUlyān, an
eminent Sūfī, relates that one day something
like a young fox came forth from his
throat, and God caused him to know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span>
it was his <i>nafs</i>. He trod on it, but it grew
bigger at every kick that he gave it. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Other things are destroyed by pain
and blows: why dost thou increase?”
“Because I was created perverse,” it
replied; “what is pain to other things
is pleasure to me, and their pleasure is
my pain.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>nafs</i> of Hallāj was seen running
behind him in the shape of a dog; and
other cases are recorded in which it appeared
as a snake or a mouse.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote">Mortification.</div>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">Mortification of the <i>nafs</i> is the chief work
of devotion, and leads, directly or indirectly,
to the contemplative life. All the Sheykhs
are agreed that no disciple who neglects
this duty will ever learn the rudiments of
Sūfism. The principle of mortification is
that the <i>nafs</i> should be weaned
from those things to which it is
accustomed, that it should be encouraged
to resist its passions, that its pride should
be broken, and that it should be brought
through suffering and tribulation to recognise
the vileness of its original nature
and the impurity of its actions. Concerning
the outward methods of mortification, such
as fasting, silence, and solitude, a great deal
might be written, but we must now pass on
to the higher ethical discipline which completes
the Path.</p>

<p>Self-mortification, as advanced Sūfīs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span>
understand it, is a moral transmutation of
the inner man. When they say, “Die
before ye die,” they do not mean to assert
that the lower self can be essentially destroyed,
but that it can and should be purged
of its attributes, which are wholly evil.
These attributes&mdash;ignorance, pride, envy,
uncharitableness, etc.&mdash;are extinguished, and
replaced by the opposite qualities, when the
will is surrendered to God and when the
mind is concentrated on Him. Therefore
‘dying to self’ is really ‘living in God.’
The mystical aspects of the doctrine thus
stated will occupy a considerable part of the
following chapters; here we are mainly
interested in its ethical import.</p>

<p>The Sūfī who has eradicated self-will is
said, in technical language, to have reached
the ‘stages’ of ‘acquiescence’ or ‘satisfaction’
(<i>ridā</i>) and ‘trust in God’ (<i>tawakkul</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A dervish fell into the Tigris. Seeing
that he could not swim, a man on the
bank cried out, “Shall I tell some one
to bring you ashore?” “No,” said the
dervish. “Then do you wish to be
drowned?” “No.” “What, then, do
you wish?” The dervish replied, “God’s
will be done! What have I to do with
wishing?”</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote">Trust in God.</div>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">‘Trust in God,’ in its extreme form, involves
the renunciation of every personal
initiative and volition; total passivity like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span>
that of a corpse in the hands of the washer
who prepares it for burial; perfect indifference
towards anything that is
even remotely connected with
one’s self. A special class of the ancient
Sūfīs took their name from this ‘trust,’
which they applied, so far as they were
able, to matters of everyday life. For instance,
they would not seek food, work for
hire, practise any trade, or allow medicine
to be given them when they were ill.
Quietly they committed themselves to God’s
care, never doubting that He, to whom
belong the treasures of earth and heaven,
would provide for their wants, and that
their allotted portion would come to them
as surely as it comes to the birds, which
neither sow nor reap, and to the fish in the
sea, and to the child in the womb.</p>

<p>These principles depend ultimately on the
Sūfistic theory of the divine unity, as is shown
by Shaqīq of Balkh in the following passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are three things which a man
is bound to practise. Whosoever neglects
any one of them must needs
neglect them all, and whosoever cleaves
to any one of them must needs cleave
to them all. Strive, therefore, to understand,
and consider heedfully.</p>

<p>“The <em>first</em> is this, that with your
mind and your tongue and your actions
you declare God to be One; and that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span>
having declared Him to be One, and
having declared that none benefits you
or harms you except Him, you devote
all your actions to Him alone. If you
act a single jot of your actions for
the sake of another, your thought and
speech are corrupt, since your motive
in acting for another’s sake must be
hope or fear; and when you act from
hope or fear of other than God, who is
the lord and sustainer of all things, you
have taken to yourself another god to
honour and venerate.</p>

<p>“<em>Secondly</em>, that while you speak and
act in the sincere belief that there is no
God except Him, you should trust Him
more than the world or money or uncle
or father or mother or any one on the
face of the earth.</p>

<p>“<em>Thirdly</em>, when you have established
these two things, namely, sincere belief
in the unity of God and trust in Him,
it behoves you to be satisfied with
Him and not to be angry on account of
anything that vexes you. Beware of
anger! Let your heart be with Him
always, let it not be withdrawn from
Him for a single moment.”</p>
</div>

<p>The ‘trusting’ Sūfī has no thought
beyond the present hour. On one occasion
Shaqīq asked those who sat listening to his
discourse:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If God causes you to die to-day,
think ye that He will demand from you
the prayers of to-morrow?” They
answered: “No; how should He demand
from us the prayers of a day on
which we are not alive?” Shaqīq said:
“Even as He will not demand from
you the prayers of to-morrow, so do ye
not seek from Him the provender of
to-morrow. It may be that ye will not
live so long.”</p>
</div>

<p>In view of the practical consequences of
attempting to live ‘on trust,’ it is not
surprising to read the advice given to those
who would perfectly fulfil the doctrine:
“Let them dig a grave and bury themselves.”
Later Sūfīs hold that active exertion
for the purpose of obtaining the means
of subsistence is quite compatible with
‘trust,’ according to the saying of the
Prophet, “Trust in God and tie the camel’s
leg.” They define <i>tawakkul</i> as an habitual
state of mind, which is impaired only by
self-pleasing thoughts; <i><abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr></i> it was accounted
a breach of ‘trust’ to think Paradise a
more desirable place than Hell.</p>

<p>What type of character is such a theory
likely to produce? At the worst, a useless
drone and hypocrite preying upon his fellow-creatures;
at the best, a harmless dervish
who remains unmoved in the midst of
sorrow, meets praise and blame with equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span>
indifference, and accepts insults, blows,
torture, and death as mere incidents in the
eternal drama of destiny. This cold morality,
however, is not the highest of which Sūfism
is capable. The highest morality springs
from nothing but love, when self-surrender
becomes self-devotion. Of that I shall have
something to say in due time.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote">Recollection.</div>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">Among the positive elements in the Sūfī
discipline there is one that Moslem mystics
unanimously regard as the keystone of
practical religion. I refer to the <i>dhikr</i>, an
exercise well known to Western readers
from the careful description given by Edward
Lane in his <cite>Modern Egyptians</cite>, and by Professor
D. B. Macdonald in his recently
published <cite>Aspects of Islam</cite>. The term
<i>dhikr</i>&mdash;‘recollection’ seems to
me the most appropriate equivalent
in English&mdash;signifies ‘mentioning,’
‘remembering,’ or simply ‘thinking of’;
in the Koran the Faithful are commanded
to “remember God often,” a plain act of
worship without any mystical savour. But
the Sūfīs made a practice of repeating the
name of God or some religious formula,
<i><abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr></i> “Glory to Allah” (<i>subhān Allah</i>), “There
is no god but Allah” (<i>lā ilāha illa ’llah</i>),
accompanying the mechanical intonation
with an intense concentration of every faculty
upon the single word or phrase; and
they attach greater value to this irregular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span>
litany, which enables them to enjoy uninterrupted
communion with God, than to
the five services of prayer performed, at
fixed hours of the day and night, by all
Moslems. Recollection may be either spoken
or silent, but it is best, according to the
usual opinion, that tongue and mind should
co-operate. Sahl ibn ʿAbdallah bade one
of his disciples endeavour to say “Allah!
Allah!” the whole day without intermission.
When he had acquired the habit of doing
so, Sahl instructed him to repeat the same
words during the night, until they came
forth from his lips even while he was asleep.
“Now,” said he, “be silent and occupy
yourself with recollecting them.” At last
the disciple’s whole being was absorbed by
the thought of Allah. One day a log fell on
his head, and the words “Allah, Allah” were
seen written in the blood that trickled from
the wound.</p>

<p>Ghazālī describes the method and effects
of <i>dhikr</i> in a passage which Macdonald has
summarised as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let him reduce his heart to a state
in which the existence of anything and
its non-existence are the same to him.
Then let him sit alone in some corner,
limiting his religious duties to what is
absolutely necessary, and not occupying
himself either with reciting the Koran
or considering its meaning or with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span>
books of religious traditions or with
anything of the sort. And let him see
to it that nothing save God most High
enters his mind. Then, as he sits in
solitude, let him not cease saying
continuously with his tongue, ‘<i>Allah,
Allah</i>,’ keeping his thought on it. At
last he will reach a state when the motion
of his tongue will cease, and it will
seem as though the word flowed from
it. Let him persevere in this until all
trace of motion is removed from his
tongue, and he finds his heart persevering
in the thought. Let him still persevere
until the form of the word, its letters
and shape, is removed from his heart,
and there remains the idea alone, as
though clinging to his heart, inseparable
from it. So far, all is dependent on his
will and choice; but to bring the mercy
of God does not stand in his will or
choice. He has now laid himself bare
to the breathings of that mercy, and
nothing remains but to await what
God will open to him, as God has done
after this manner to prophets and saints.
If he follows the above course, he may
be sure that the light of the Real will
shine out in his heart. At first unstable,
like a flash of lightning, it turns and
returns; though sometimes it hangs
back. And if it returns, sometimes it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span>
abides and sometimes it is momentary.
And if it abides, sometimes its abiding
is long, and sometimes short.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another Sūfī puts the gist of the matter
in a sentence, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The first stage of <i>dhikr</i> is to forget
self, and the last stage is the effacement
of the worshipper in the act of
worship, without consciousness of worship,
and such absorption in the object
of worship as precludes return to the
subject thereof.”</p>
</div>

<p>Recollection can be aided in various ways.
When Shiblī was a novice, he went daily
into a cellar, taking with him a bundle of
sticks. If his attention flagged, he would
beat himself until the sticks broke, and
sometimes the whole bundle would be
finished before evening; then he would
dash his hands and feet against the wall.
The Indian practice of inhaling and exhaling
the breath was known to the Sūfīs of the
ninth century and was much used afterwards.
Among the Dervish Orders music, singing,
and dancing are favourite means of inducing
the state of trance called ‘passing-away’
(<i>fanā</i>), which, as appears from the definition
quoted above, is the climax and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</i>
of the method.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote">Meditation.</div>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">In ‘meditation’ (<i>murāqabat</i>) we recognise
a form of self-concentration similar to the
Buddhistic <i>dhyāna</i> and <i>samādhi</i>. This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span>
what the Prophet meant when he said,
“Worship God as though thou sawest Him,
for if thou seest Him not, yet He sees thee.”
Any one who feels sure that God is always
watching over him will devote himself to
meditating on God, and no evil
thoughts or diabolic suggestions
will find their way into his heart. Nūrī
used to meditate so intently that not a hair
on his body stirred. He declared that he
had learned this habit from a cat which
was observing a mouse-hole, and that she
was far more quiet than he. Abū Saʿīd
ibn Abi ’l-Khayr kept his eyes fixed on his
navel. It is said that the Devil is smitten
with epilepsy when he approaches a man
thus occupied, just as happens to other men
when the Devil takes possession of them.</p>

<p>This chapter will have served its purpose
if it has brought before my readers a clear
view of the main lines on which the preparatory
training of the Sūfī is conducted.
We must now imagine him to have been
invested by his Sheykh with the patched
frock (<i>muraqqaʿat</i> or <i>khirqat</i>), which is an
outward sign that he has successfully
emerged from the discipline of the ‘Path,’
and is now advancing with uncertain steps
towards the Light, as when toil-worn
travellers, having gained the summit of a
deep gorge, suddenly catch glimpses of the
sun and cover their eyes.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="smcap">God</span>, who is described in the Koran as “the
Light of the heavens and the earth,” cannot
be seen by the bodily eye. He is visible
only to the inward sight of the ‘heart.’
In <a href="#Chapter_3" title="Go to Chapter 3">the next chapter</a> we shall return to this
spiritual organ, but I am not going to enter
into the intricacies of Sūfī psychology any
further than is necessary. The ‘vision of
the heart’ (<i>ruʾyat al-qalb</i>) is defined as “the
heart’s beholding by the light of certainty
that which is hidden in the unseen world.”
This is what ʿAlī meant when he was
asked, “Do you see God?” and replied:
“How should we worship One whom we do
not see?” The light of intuitive certainty
(<i>yaqīn</i>) by which the heart sees God is a
beam of God’s own light cast therein by
Himself; else no vision of Him were possible.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“’Tis the sun’s self that lets the sun be seen.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>According to a mystical interpretation
of the famous passage in the Koran where
the light of Allah is compared to a candle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span>
burning in a lantern of transparent glass,
which is placed in a niche in the wall, the
niche is the true believer’s heart; therefore
his speech is light and his works are light
and he moves in light. “He who discourses
of eternity,” said Bāyazīd, “must have
within him the lamp of eternity.”</p>

<p>The light which gleams in the heart of
the illuminated mystic endows him with a
supernatural power of discernment (<i>firāsat</i>).
Although the Sūfīs, like all other Moslems,
acknowledge Mohammed to be the last of
the prophets (as, from a different point of
view, he is the Logos or first of created
beings), they really claim to possess a minor
form of inspiration. When Nūrī was questioned
concerning the origin of mystical
<i>firāsat</i>, he answered by quoting the Koranic
verse in which God says that He breathed
His spirit into Adam; but the more orthodox
Sūfīs, who <a id="TN2">strenuously</a> combat the
doctrine that the human spirit is uncreated
and eternal, affirm that <i>firāsat</i> is the result
of knowledge and insight, metaphorically
called ‘light’ or ‘inspiration,’ which God
creates and bestows upon His favourites.
The Tradition, “Beware of the discernment
of the true believer, for he sees by the light
of Allah,” is exemplified in such anecdotes
as these:</p>

<p>Abū ʿAbdallah al-Rāzī said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ibn al-Anbārī presented me with a
woollen frock, and seeing on the head
of Shiblī a bonnet that would just
match it, I conceived the wish that
they were both mine. When Shiblī
rose to depart, he looked at me, as he
was in the habit of doing when he
desired me to follow him. So I followed
him to his house, and when we had gone
in, he bade me put off the frock and
took it from me and folded it and threw
his bonnet on the top. Then he called
for a fire and burnt both frock and
bonnet.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sarī al-Saqatī frequently urged Junayd
to speak in public, but Junayd was unwilling
to consent, for he doubted whether he was
worthy of such an honour. One Friday night
he dreamed that the Prophet appeared and
commanded him to speak to the people.
He awoke and went to Sarī’s house before
daybreak, and knocked at the door. Sarī
opened the door and said: “You would not
believe me until the Prophet came and told
you.”</p>

<p>Sahl ibn ʿAbdallah was sitting in the congregational
mosque when a pigeon, overcome
by the intense heat, dropped on the floor.
Sahl exclaimed: “Please God, Shāh al-Kirmānī
has just died.” They wrote it
down, and it was found to be true.</p>

<p>When the heart is purged of sin and evil
thoughts, the light of certainty strikes upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span>
it and makes it a shining mirror, so that
the Devil cannot approach it without being
observed. Hence the saying of some
gnostic: “If I disobey my heart, I disobey
God.” It was a man thus illuminated to
whom the Prophet said: “Consult thy
heart, and thou wilt hear the secret ordinance
of God proclaimed by the heart’s inward
knowledge, which is real faith and divinity”&mdash;something
much better than the learning
of divines. I need not anticipate here the
question, which will be discussed in <a href="#Chapter_3" title="Go to Chapter 3">the
following chapter</a>, how far the claims of an
infallible conscience are reconcilable with
external religion and morality. The
Prophet, too, prayed that God would put a
light into his ear and into his eye; and after
mentioning the different members of his
body, he concluded, “and make the whole
of me one light.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> From illumination of
gradually increasing splendour, the mystic
rises to contemplation of the divine attributes,
and ultimately, when his consciousness
is wholly melted away, he becomes transubstantiated
(<i>tajawhara</i>) in the radiance of
the divine essence. This is the ‘station’
of well-doing (<i>ihsān</i>)&mdash;for “God is with the
well-doers” (Kor. <span class="bold">29.</span> 69), and we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span>
Prophetic authority for the statement that
“well-doing consists in worshipping God
as though thou wert seeing Him.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> The reader should be reminded that most, if not all,
mystical Traditions ascribed to Mohammed were forged
and fathered upon him by the Sūfīs, who represent themselves
as the true interpreters of his esoteric teaching.</p>

</div>

<p>I will not waste the time and abuse the
patience of my readers by endeavouring to
classify and describe these various grades of
illumination, which may be depicted symbolically
but cannot be explained in scientific
language. We must allow the mystics to
speak for themselves. Granted that their
teaching is often hard to understand, it
conveys more of the truth than we can
ever hope to obtain from analysis and dissection.</p>

<p>Here are two passages from the oldest
Persian treatise on Sūfism, the <cite>Kashf al-Mahjūb</cite>
of Hujwīrī:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is related that Sarī al-Saqatī
said, ‘O God, whatever punishment
thou mayst inflict upon me, do not
punish me with the humiliation of
being veiled from Thee,’ because, if I
am not veiled from Thee, my torment
and affliction will be lightened by
the recollection and contemplation of
Thee; but if I am veiled from Thee,
even Thy bounty will be deadly to me.
There is no punishment in Hell more
painful and hard to bear than that of
being veiled. If God were revealed in
Hell to the people of Hell, sinful believers
would never think of Paradise, since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span>
the sight of God would so fill them with
joy that they would not feel bodily
pain. And in Paradise there is no
pleasure more perfect than unveiledness.
If the people there enjoyed all
the pleasures of that place and other
pleasures a hundredfold, but were
veiled from God, their hearts would
be utterly broken. Therefore it is the
way of God to let the hearts of those
who love Him have vision of Him
always, in order that the delight thereof
may enable them to endure every
tribulation; and they say in their
visions, ‘We deem all torments more
desirable than to be veiled from Thee.
When Thy beauty is revealed to our
hearts, we take no thought of affliction.’”</p>

<p>“There are really two kinds of contemplation.
The former is the result
of perfect faith, the latter of rapturous
love, for in the rapture of love a man
attains to such a degree that his whole
being is absorbed in the thought of
his Beloved and he sees nothing else.
Muhammad ibn Wāsiʿ said: ‘I never
saw anything without seeing God therein,’
<i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> through perfect faith. Shiblī
said: ‘I never saw anything except
God,’ <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> in the rapture of love and the
fervour of contemplation. One mystic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span>
sees the act with his bodily eye, and,
as he looks, beholds the Agent with his
spiritual eye; another is rapt by love
of the Agent from all things else, so
that he sees only the Agent. The one
method is demonstrative, the other is
ecstatic. In the former case, a manifest
proof is derived from the evidences
of God; in the latter case, the seer is
enraptured and transported by desire:
evidences are a veil to him, because he
who knows a thing does not care for
aught besides, and he who loves a
thing does not regard aught besides,
but renounces contention with God
and interference with Him in His
decrees and acts. When the lover turns
his eye away from created things, he
will inevitably see the Creator with
his heart. God hath said, ‘Tell the
believers to close their eyes’ (Kor.
<span class="bold">24.</span> 30), <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> to close their bodily eyes
to lusts and their spiritual eyes to
created things. He who is most sincere
in self-mortification is most firmly
grounded in contemplation. Sahl ibn
ʿAbdallah of Tustar said: ‘If any one
shuts his eye to God for a single
moment, he will never be rightly
guided all his life long,’ because to
regard other than God is to be handed
over to other than God, and one who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span>
left at the mercy of other than God is
lost. Therefore the life of contemplatives
is the time during which they
enjoy contemplation; time spent in
ocular vision they do not reckon as
life, for that to them is really death.
Thus, when Bāyazīd was asked how
old he was, he replied, ‘Four years.’
They said to him, ‘How can that be?’
He answered, ‘I have been veiled from
God by this world for seventy years,
but I have seen Him during the last
four years: the period in which one is
veiled does not belong to one’s life.’”</p>
</div>

<p>I take the following quotation from the
<cite>Mawāqif</cite> of Niffarī, an author with whom
we shall become better acquainted as we
proceed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“God said to me, ‘The least of the
sciences of nearness is that you should
see in everything the effects of beholding
Me, and that this vision should prevail
over you more than your gnosis of
Me.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Explanation by the commentator:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He means that the least of the
sciences of nearness (proximity to God)
is that when you look at anything,
sensibly or intellectually or otherwise,
you should be conscious of beholding
God with a vision clearer than your
vision of that thing. There are diverse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span>
degrees in this matter. Some mystics
say that they never see anything without
seeing God before it. Others say,
‘without seeing God after it,’ or ‘with
it’; or they say that they see nothing
but God. A certain Sūfī said, ‘I made
the pilgrimage and saw the Kaʿba, but
not the Lord of the Kaʿba.’ This is
the perception of one who is veiled.
Then he said, ‘I made the pilgrimage
again, and I saw both the Kaʿba and
the Lord of the Kaʿba.’ This is contemplation
of the Self-subsistence
through which everything subsists, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>
he saw the Kaʿba subsisting through
the Lord of the Kaʿba. Then he said,
‘I made the pilgrimage a third time,
and I saw the Lord of the Kaʿba, but
not the Kaʿba.’ This is the ‘station’
of <i>waqfat</i> (passing-away in the essence).
In the present case the author is referring
to contemplation of the Self-subsistence.”</p>
</div>

<p>So much concerning the theory of illumination.
But, as Mephistopheles says,
“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">grau ist alle Theorie</i>”; and though to most
of us the living experience is denied, we can
hear its loudest echoes and feel its warmest
afterglow in the poetry which it has created.
Let me translate part of a Persian ode by
the dervish-poet, Bābā Kūhī of Shīrāz, who

<p class="sp1">The whole of Sūfism rests on the belief
that when the individual self is lost, the
Universal Self is found, or, in religious
language, that ecstasy affords the only
means by which the soul can directly communicate
and become united with God.
Asceticism, purification, love, gnosis, saintship&mdash;all
the leading ideas of Sūfism&mdash;are
developed from this cardinal principle.</p>

<p>Among the metaphorical terms commonly
employed by the Sūfīs as, more or less,
equivalent to ‘ecstasy’ are <i>fanā</i> (passing-away),
<i>wajd</i> (feeling), <i>samāʿ</i> (hearing), <i>dhawq</i>
(taste), <i>shirb</i> (drinking), <i>ghaybat</i> (absence
from self), <i>jadhbat</i> (attraction), <i>sukr</i> (intoxication),
and <i>hāl</i> (emotion). It would
be tedious and not, I think, specially instructive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span>
to examine in detail the definitions
of those terms and of many others akin to
them which occur in Sūfī text-books. We
are not brought appreciably nearer to understanding
the nature of ecstasy when it is
described as “a divine mystery which God
communicates to true believers who behold
Him with the eye of certainty,” or as “a
flame which moves in the ground of the
soul and is produced by love-desire.” The
Mohammedan theory of ecstasy, however,
can hardly be discussed without reference to
two of the above-mentioned technical expressions,
namely, <i>fanā</i> and <i>samāʿ</i>.</p>

<p>As I have remarked in the Introduction
<a href="#Page_17">(pp. 17-19)</a>, the term <i>fanā</i> includes different
stages, aspects, and meanings. These may
be summarised as follows:</p>

<p>1. A moral transformation of the soul
through the extinction of all its passions
and desires.</p>

<p>2. A mental abstraction or passing-away
of the mind from all objects of perception,
thoughts, actions, and feelings through its
concentration upon the thought of God.
Here the thought of God signifies contemplation
of the divine attributes.</p>

<p>3. The cessation of all conscious thought.
The highest stage of <i>fanā</i> is reached when
even the consciousness of having attained
<i>fanā</i> disappears. This is what the Sūfīs
call ‘the passing-away of passing-away’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>
(<i>fanā al-fanā</i>). The mystic is now rapt in
contemplation of the divine essence.</p>

<p>The final stage of <i>fanā</i>, the complete passing-away
from self, forms the prelude to <i>baqā</i>,
‘continuance’ or ‘abiding’ in God, and will
be treated with greater fullness in <a href="#Chapter_6" title="Go to Chapter 6">Chapter <abbr title="6">VI.</abbr></a></p>

<p>The first stage closely resembles the
Buddhistic Nirvāṇa. It is a ‘passing-away’
of evil qualities and states of mind, which
involves the simultaneous ‘continuance’ of
good qualities and states of mind. This is
necessarily an ecstatic process, inasmuch as
all the attributes of ‘self’ are evil in relation
to God. No one can make himself perfectly
moral, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> perfectly ‘selfless.’ This must
be done for him, through ‘a flash of the
divine beauty’ in his heart.</p>

<p>While the first stage refers to the moral
‘self,’ the second refers to the percipient
and intellectual ‘self.’ Using the classification
generally adopted by Christian mystics,
we may regard the former as the consummation
of the Purgative Life, and the latter
as the goal of the Illuminative Life. The
third and last stage constitutes the highest
level of the Contemplative Life.</p>

<p>Often, though not invariably, <i>fanā</i> is
accompanied by loss of sensation. Sarī
al-Saqatī, a famous Sūfī of the third century,
expressed the opinion that if a man in this
state were struck on the face with a sword,
he would not feel the blow. Abu ’l-Khayr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span>
al-Aqtaʿ had a gangrene in his foot. The
physicians declared that his foot must be
amputated, but he would not allow this to
be done. His disciples said, “Cut it off while
he is praying, for he is then unconscious.”
The physicians acted on their advice, and
when Abu ’l-Khayr finished his prayers he
found that the amputation had taken place.
It is difficult to see how any one far advanced
in <i>fanā</i> could be capable of keeping the
religious law&mdash;a point on which the orthodox
mystics lay great emphasis. Here the
doctrine of saintship comes in. God takes
care to preserve His elect from disobedience
to His commands. We are told that Bāyazīd,
Shiblī, and other saints were continually in
a state of rapture until the hour of prayer
arrived; then they returned to consciousness,
and after performing their prayers
became enraptured again.</p>

<p>In theory, the ecstatic trance is involuntary,
although certain conditions are recognised
as being specially favourable to its occurrence.
“It comes to a man through vision of the
majesty of God and through revelation of
the divine omnipotence to his heart.” Such,
for instance, was the case of Abū Hamza,
who, while walking in the streets of Baghdād
and meditating on the nearness of God,
suddenly fell into an ecstasy and went on
his way, neither seeing nor hearing, until he
recovered his senses and found himself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span>
the desert. Trances of this kind sometimes
lasted many weeks. It is recorded of Sahl
ibn ʿAbdallah that he used to remain in
ecstasy twenty-five days at a time, eating
no food; yet he would answer questions put
to him by the doctors of theology, and even
in winter his shirt would be damp with sweat.
But the Sūfīs soon discovered that ecstasy
might be induced artificially, not only by
concentration of thought, recollection (<i>dhikr</i>),
and other innocent methods of autohypnosis,
but also by music, singing, and dancing.
These are included in the term <i>samāʿ</i>, which
properly means nothing more than audition.</p>

<p>That Moslems are extraordinarily susceptible
to the sweet influences of sound will
not be doubted by any one who remembers
how, in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, heroes and
heroines alike swoon upon the slightest provocation
afforded by a singing-girl touching
her lute and trilling a few lines of passionate
verse. The fiction is true to life. When
Sūfī writers discuss the analogous phenomena
of ecstasy, they commonly do so in a
chapter entitled ‘Concerning the <i>Samāʿ</i>.’
Under this heading Hujwīrī, in the final
chapter of his <cite>Kashf al-Mahjūb</cite>, gives us
an excellent summary of his own and
other Mohammedan theories, together with
numerous anecdotes of persons who were
thrown into ecstasy on hearing a verse of the
Koran or a heavenly voice (<i>hātif</i>) or poetry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span>
or music. Many are said to have died from
the emotion thus aroused. I may add by
way of explanation that, according to a
well-known mystical belief, God has inspired
every created thing to praise Him in its
own language, so that all the sounds in
the universe form, as it were, one vast
choral hymn by which He glorifies Himself.
Consequently those whose hearts He
has opened and endowed with spiritual
perception hear His voice everywhere, and
ecstasy overcomes them as they listen to
the rhythmic chant of the muezzin, or the
street cry of the saqqā shouldering his water-skin,
or, perchance, to the noise of wind or
the bleating of a sheep or the piping of a bird.</p>

<p>Pythagoras and Plato are responsible for
another theory, to which the Sūfī poets
frequently allude, that music awakens in
the soul a memory of celestial harmonies
heard in a state of pre-existence, before the
soul was separated from God. Thus Jalāluddīn
Rūmī:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span></p>

<p>The formal practice of <i>samāʿ</i> quickly
spread amongst the Sūfīs and produced an
acute cleavage of opinion, some holding it
to be lawful and praiseworthy, whilst others
condemned it as an abominable innovation
and incitement to vice. Hujwīrī adopts
the middle view expressed in a saying of
Dhu ’l-Nūn the Egyptian:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Music is a divine influence which
stirs the heart to seek God: those who
listen to it spiritually attain unto God,
and those who listen to it sensually
fall into unbelief.”</p>
</div>

<p>He declares, in effect, that audition is
neither good nor bad, and must be judged by
its results.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When an anchorite goes into a
tavern, the tavern becomes his cell,
but when a wine-bibber goes into a cell,
that cell becomes his tavern.”</p>
</div>

<p>One whose heart is absorbed in the thought
of God cannot be corrupted by hearing
musical instruments. So with dancing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the heart throbs and rapture
grows intense, and the agitation of
ecstasy is manifested and conventional
forms are gone, this is not dancing nor
bodily indulgence, but a dissolution
of the soul.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hujwīrī, however, lays down several precautionary
rules for those who engage in
audition, and he confesses that the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span>
concerts given by dervishes are extremely
demoralising. Novices, he thinks, should
not be permitted to attend them. In modern
times these orgiastic scenes have frequently
been described by eye-witnesses. I will
now translate from Jāmī’s <cite>Lives of the Saints</cite>
the account of a similar performance which
took place about seven hundred years ago.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There was a certain dervish, a negro
called Zangī Bashgirdī, who had attained
to such a high degree of spirituality
that the mystic dance could not
be started until he came out and joined
in it. One day, in the course of the
<i>samāʿ</i>, he was seized with ecstasy, and
rising into the air seated himself on a
lofty arch which overlooked the dancers.
In descending he leaped on to Majduddīn
of Baghdād, and encircled with
his legs the neck of the Sheykh, who
nevertheless continued to spin round in
the dance, though he was a very frail
and slender man, whereas the negro
was tall and heavy. When the dance
was finished, Majduddīn said, ‘I did
not know whether it was a negro or a
sparrow on my neck.’ On getting off
the Sheykh’s shoulders, the negro bit his
cheek so severely that the scar remained
visible ever after. Majduddīn
often used to say that on the Day of
Judgment he would not boast of anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span>
except that he bore the mark of
this negro’s teeth on his face.”</p>
</div>

<p>Grotesque and ignoble features&mdash;not to
speak of grosser deformities&mdash;must appear
in any faithful delineation of the ecstatic life
of Islam. Nothing is gained by concealing
their existence or by minimising their importance.
If, as Jalāluddīn Rūmī says:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III"><a id="Chapter_3">CHAPTER <abbr title="3">III</abbr></a><br /> <br /><span class="fs75">THE GNOSIS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="smcap">The</span> Sūfīs distinguish three organs of
spiritual communication: the heart (<i>qalb</i>),
which knows God; the spirit (<i>rūh</i>), which
loves Him; and the inmost ground of the
soul (<i>sirr</i>), which contemplates Him. It
would take us into deep waters if we were
to embark upon a discussion of these terms
and their relation to each other. A few
words concerning the first of the three will
suffice. The <i>qalb</i>, though connected in some
mysterious way with the physical heart,
is not a thing of flesh and blood. Unlike
the English ‘heart,’ its nature is rather
intellectual than emotional, but whereas
the intellect cannot gain real knowledge of
God, the <i>qalb</i> is capable of knowing the
essences of all things, and when illumined
by faith and knowledge reflects the whole
content of the divine mind; hence the
Prophet said, “My earth and My heaven
contain Me not, but the heart of My faithful
servant containeth Me.” This revelation,
however, is a comparatively rare experience.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span>
Normally, the heart is ‘veiled,’ blackened
by sin, tarnished by sensual impressions and
images, pulled to and fro between reason
and passion: a battlefield on which the
armies of God and the Devil contend for
victory. Through one gate, the heart receives
immediate knowledge of God; through
another, it lets in the illusions of sense.
“Here a world and there a world,” says
Jalāluddīn Rūmī. “I am seated on the
threshold.” Therefore man is potentially lower
than the brutes and higher than the angels.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Angel and brute man’s wondrous leaven compose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To these inclining, less than these he grows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if he means the angel, more than those.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Less than the brutes, because they lack
the knowledge that would enable them to
rise; more than the angels, because they are
not subject to passion and so cannot fall.</p>

<p>How shall a man know God? Not by
the senses, for He is immaterial; nor by
the intellect, for He is unthinkable. Logic
never gets beyond the finite; philosophy
sees double; book-learning fosters self-conceit
and obscures the idea of the Truth
with clouds of empty words. Jalāluddīn
Rūmī, addressing the scholastic theologian,
asks scornfully:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do you know a name without a thing answering to it?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have you ever plucked a rose from R, O, S, E?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You name His name; go, seek the reality named by it!</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look for the moon in the sky, not in the water!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you desire to rise above mere names and letters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make yourself free from self at one stroke.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Become pure from all attributes of self,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That you may see your own bright essence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, see in your own heart the knowledge of the Prophet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without book, without tutor, without preceptor.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This knowledge comes by illumination,
revelation, inspiration.</p>

<p>“Look in your own heart,” says the
Sūfī, “for the kingdom of God is within
you.” He who truly knows himself knows
God, for the heart is a mirror in which
every divine quality is reflected. But just
as a steel mirror when coated with rust
loses its power of reflexion, so the inward
spiritual sense, which Sūfīs call the eye of
the heart, is blind to the celestial glory
until the dark obstruction of the phenomenal
self, with all its sensual contaminations, has
been wholly cleared away. The clearance,
if it is to be done effectively, must be the
work of God, though it demands a certain
inward co-operation on the part of man.
“Whosoever shall strive for Our sake, We
will guide him into Our ways” (Kor. <span class="bold">29.</span> 69).
Action is false and vain, if it is thought to
proceed from one’s self, but the enlightened
mystic regards God as the real agent in
every act, and therefore takes no credit for
his good works nor desires to be recompensed
for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span></p>

<p>While ordinary knowledge is denoted by
the term <i>ʿilm</i>, the mystic knowledge peculiar
to the Sūfīs is called <i>maʿrifat</i> or <i>ʿirfān</i>. As
I have indicated in the foregoing paragraphs,
<i>maʿrifat</i> is fundamentally different from <i>ʿilm</i>,
and a different word must be used to
translate it. We need not look far for a
suitable equivalent. The <i>maʿrifat</i> of the
Sūfīs is the ‘gnosis’ of Hellenistic theosophy,
<i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> direct knowledge of God based on
revelation or apocalyptic vision. It is not
the result of any mental process, but depends
entirely on the will and favour of God, who
bestows it as a gift from Himself upon
those whom He has created with the capacity
for receiving it. It is a light of divine
grace that flashes into the heart and
overwhelms every human faculty in its
dazzling beams. “He who knows God is
dumb.”</p>

<p>The relation of gnosis to positive religion
is discussed in a very remarkable treatise
on speculative mysticism by Niffarī, an
unknown wandering dervish who died in
Egypt in the latter half of the tenth century.
His work, consisting of a series of revelations
in which God addresses the writer and
instructs him concerning the theory of
gnosis, is couched in abstruse language and
would scarcely be intelligible without the
commentary which accompanies it; but its
value as an original exposition of advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span>
Sūfism will sufficiently appear from the
excerpts given in this chapter.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> I am now engaged in preparing an edition of the Arabic
text, together with an English translation and commentary.</p>

</div>

<p>Those who seek God, says Niffarī, are of
three kinds: <em>firstly</em>, the worshippers to
whom God makes Himself known by means
of bounty, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> they worship Him in the
hope of winning Paradise or some spiritual
recompense such as dreams and miracles;
<em>secondly</em>, the philosophers and scholastic
theologians, to whom God makes Himself
known by means of glory, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> they can
never find the glorious God whom they
seek, wherefore they assert that His essence
is unknowable, saying, “We know that we
know Him not, and that is our knowledge”;
<em>thirdly</em>, the gnostics, to whom God makes
Himself known by means of ecstasy, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>
they are possessed and controlled by a
rapture that deprives them of the consciousness
of individual existence.</p>

<p>Niffarī bids the gnostic perform only
such acts of worship as are in accordance
with his vision of God, though in so doing
he will necessarily disobey the religious
law which was made for the vulgar. His
inward feeling must decide how far the
external forms of religion are good for him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“God said to me, Ask Me and say,
‘O Lord, how shall I cleave to Thee,
so that when my day (of judgment)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span>
comes, Thou wilt not punish me nor
avert Thy face from me?’ Then I
will answer thee and say, ‘Cleave in
thy outward theory and practice to the
Sunna (the rule of the Prophet), and
cleave in thy inward feeling to the
gnosis which I have given thee; and
know that when I make Myself known
to thee, I will not accept from thee
anything of the Sunna but what My
gnosis brings to thee, because thou art
one of those to whom I speak: thou
hearest Me and knowest that thou
hearest Me, and thou seest that I am
the source of all things.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The commentator observes that the Sunna,
being general in scope, makes no distinction
between individuals, <i><abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr></i> seekers of Paradise
and seekers of God, but that in reality it
contains exactly what each person requires.
The portion specially appropriate in every
case is discerned either by means of gnosis,
which God communicates to the heart, or
by means of guidance imparted by a spiritual
director.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And He said to me, ‘My exoteric
revelation does not support My esoteric
revelation.’”</p>
</div>

<p>This means that the gnostic need not be
dismayed if his inner experience conflicts
with the religious law. The contradiction
is only apparent. Religion addresses itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span>
to the common herd of men who are veiled
by their minds, by logic, tradition, and so
on; whereas gnosis belongs to the elect,
whose bodies and spirits are bathed in the
eternal Light. Religion sees things from
the aspect of plurality, but gnosis regards
the all-embracing Unity. Hence the same
act is good in religion, but evil in gnosis&mdash;a
truth which is briefly stated thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The good deeds of the pious are the
ill deeds of the favourites of God.”</p>
</div>

<p>Although works of devotion are not incompatible
with gnosis, no one who connects
them in the slightest degree with himself
is a gnostic. This is the theme of the following
allegory. Niffarī seldom writes so
lucidly as he does here, yet I fancy that
few of my readers will find the explanations
printed within square brackets altogether
superfluous.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Revelation of the Sea</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“God bade me behold the Sea, and I
saw the ships sinking and the planks
floating; then the planks too were
submerged.”</p>

<p>[The Sea denotes the spiritual experiences
through which the mystic
passes in his journey to God. The
point at issue is this: whether he
should prefer the religious law or disinterested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span>
love. Here he is warned not
to rely on his good works, which are no
better than sinking ships and will never
bring him safely to port. No; if he
would attain to God, he must rely on
God alone. If he does not rely entirely
on God, but lets himself trust ever so little
in anything else, he is still clinging to a
plank. Though his trust in God is greater
than before, it is not yet complete.]</p>

<p>“And He said to me, ‘Those who
voyage are not saved.’”</p>

<p>[The voyager uses the ship as a
means of crossing the sea: therefore
he relies, not on the First Cause, but on
secondary causes.]</p>

<p>“And He said to me, ‘Those who
instead of voyaging cast themselves into
the Sea take a risk.’”</p>

<p>[To abandon all secondary causes is
like plunging in the sea. The mystic
who makes this venture is in jeopardy,
for two reasons: he may regard himself,
not God, as initiating and carrying
out the action of abandonment,&mdash;and
one who renounces a thing through
‘self’ is in worse case than if he had
not renounced it,&mdash;or he may abandon
secondary causes (good works, hope of
Paradise, etc.), not for God’s sake, but
from sheer indifference and lack of
spiritual feeling.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span></p>

<p>“And He said to me, ‘Those who
voyage and take no risk shall perish.’”</p>

<p>[Notwithstanding the dangers referred
to, he must make God his sole
object or fail.]</p>

<p>“And He said to me, ‘In taking the
risk there is a part of salvation.’”</p>

<p>[Only a part of salvation, because
perfect selflessness has not yet been
attained. The whole of salvation consists
in the effacement of all secondary
causes, all phenomena, through the
rapture which results from vision of
God. But this is gnosis, and the present
revelation is addressed to mystics
of a lower grade. The gnostic takes
no risk, for he has nothing to lose.]</p>

<p>“And the wave came and lifted
those beneath it and overran the shore.”</p>

<p>[Those beneath the wave are they
who voyage in ships and consequently
suffer shipwreck. Their reliance on
secondary causes casts them ashore,
<i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> brings them back to the world of
phenomena whereby they are veiled

<p class="sp1">The gnostic descries the element of reality
in positive religion, but his gnosis is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span>
derived from religion or from any sort of
human knowledge: it is properly concerned
with the divine attributes, and God Himself
reveals the knowledge of these to His
saints who contemplate Him. Dhu ’l-Nūn
of Egypt, whose mystical speculations mark
him out as the father of Moslem theosophy,
said that gnostics are not themselves, and
do not subsist through themselves, but so
far as they subsist, they subsist through God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They move as God causes them to
move, and their words are the words of
God which roll upon their tongues, and
their sight is the sight of God which
has entered their eyes.”</p>
</div>

<p>The gnostic contemplates the attributes
of God, not His essence, for even in gnosis
a small trace of duality remains: this disappears
only in <i>fanā al-fanā</i>, the total
passing-away in the undifferentiated Godhead.
The cardinal attribute of God is
unity, and the divine unity is the first and
last principle of gnosis.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> According to some mystics, the gnosis of unity constitutes
a higher stage which is called ‘the Truth’ (<i>haqīqat</i>).
See above, <a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Both Moslem and Sūfī declare that God
is One, but the statement bears a different
meaning in each instance. The Moslem
means that God is unique in His essence,
qualities, and acts; that He is absolutely
unlike all other beings. The Sūfī means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span>
that God is the One Real Being which
underlies all phenomena. This principle is
carried to its extreme consequences, as we
shall see. If nothing except God exists,
then the whole universe, including man, is
essentially one with God, whether it is
regarded as an emanation which proceeds
from Him, without impairing His unity,
like sunbeams from the sun, or whether it is
conceived as a mirror in which the divine
attributes are reflected. But surely a God
who is all in all can have no reason for
thus revealing Himself: why should the One
pass over into the Many? The Sūfīs answer&mdash;a
philosopher would say that they evade
the difficulty&mdash;by quoting the famous Tradition:
“I was a hidden treasure and I desired
to be known; therefore I created the creation
in order that I might be known.” In
other words, God is the eternal Beauty,
and it lies in the nature of beauty to desire
love. The mystic poets have described the
self-manifestation of the One with a profusion
of splendid imagery. Jāmī says, for
example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From all eternity the Beloved unveiled His beauty in the solitude of the unseen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He held up the mirror to His own face, He displayed His loveliness to Himself.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was both the spectator and the spectacle; no eye but His had surveyed the Universe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All was One, there was no duality, no pretence of ‘mine’ or ‘thine.’</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vast orb of Heaven, with its myriad incomings and outgoings, was concealed in a single point.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Creation lay cradled in the sleep of non-existence, like a child ere it has breathed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The eye of the Beloved, seeing what was not, regarded nonentity as existent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Although He beheld His attributes and qualities as a perfect whole in His own essence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet He desired that they should be displayed to Him in another mirror,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that each one of His eternal attributes should become manifest accordingly in a diverse form.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore He created the verdant fields of Time and Space and the life-giving garden of the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That every branch and leaf and fruit might show forth His various perfections.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cypress gave a hint of His comely stature, the rose gave tidings of His beauteous countenance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherever Beauty peeped out, Love appeared beside it; wherever Beauty shone in a rosy cheek, Love lit his torch from that flame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherever Beauty dwelt in dark tresses, Love came and found a heart entangled in their coils.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beauty and Love are as body and soul; Beauty is the mine and Love the precious stone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They have always been together from the very first; never have they travelled but in each other’s company.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="sp1">In another work Jāmī sets forth the
relation of God to the world more philosophically,
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The unique Substance, viewed as
Absolute and void of all phenomena, all
limitations and all multiplicity, is the
Real (<i>al-Haqq</i>). On the other hand,
viewed in His aspect of multiplicity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span>
plurality, under which He displays Himself
when clothed with phenomena, He
is the whole created universe. Therefore
the universe is the outward visible
expression of the Real, and the Real is
the inner unseen reality of the universe.
The universe before it was evolved to
outward view was identical with the
Real; and the Real after this evolution
is identical with the universe.”</p>
</div>

<p>Phenomena, as such, are not-being and
only derive a contingent existence from the
qualities of Absolute Being by which they
are irradiated. The sensible world resembles
the fiery circle made by a single
spark whirling round rapidly.</p>

<p>Man is the crown and final cause of the
universe. Though last in the order of creation
he is first in the process of divine
thought, for the essential part of him is
the primal Intelligence or universal Reason
which emanates immediately from the Godhead.
This corresponds to the Logos&mdash;the
animating principle of all things&mdash;and
is identified with the Prophet Mohammed.
An interesting parallel might be drawn here
between the Christian and Sūfī doctrines.
The same expressions are applied to the
founder of Islam which are used by St. John,
St. Paul, and later mystical theologians
concerning Christ. Thus, Mohammed is
called the Light of God, he is said to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span>
existed before the creation of the world,
he is adored as the source of all life, actual
and possible, he is the Perfect Man in whom
all the divine attributes are manifested,
and a Sūfī tradition ascribes to him the
saying “He that hath seen me hath seen
Allah.” In the Moslem scheme, however,
the Logos doctrine occupies a subordinate
place, as it obviously must when the whole
duty of man is believed to consist in realising
the unity of God. The most distinctive
feature of Oriental as opposed to European
mysticism is its profound consciousness of
an omnipresent, all-pervading unity in which
every vestige of individuality is swallowed
up. Not to become <em>like</em> God or <em>personally</em>
to participate in the divine nature is the
Sūfī’s aim, but to escape from the bondage
of his unreal selfhood and thereby to be
reunited with the One infinite Being.</p>

<p>According to Jāmī, Unification consists
in making the heart single&mdash;that is, in purifying
and divesting it of attachment to aught
except God, both in respect of desire and
will and also as regards knowledge and
gnosis. The mystic’s desire and will should
be severed from all things which are desired
and willed; all objects of knowledge and
understanding should be removed from his
intellectual vision. His thoughts should be
directed solely towards God, he should not
be conscious of anything besides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span></p>

<p>So long as he is a captive in the snare of
passion and lust, it is hard for him to maintain
this relation to God, but when the subtle
influence of that attraction becomes manifest
in him, expelling preoccupation with objects
of sense and cognition from his inward
being, delight in that divine communion
prevails over bodily pleasures and spiritual
joys; the painful task of self-mortification
is ended, and the sweetness of contemplation
enravishes his soul.</p>

<p>When the sincere aspirant perceives in
himself the beginning of this attraction,
which is delight in the recollection of God,
let him fix his whole mind on fostering
and strengthening it, let him keep himself
aloof from whatsoever is incompatible with
it, and deem that even though he were to
devote an eternity to cultivating that communion,
he would have done nothing and
would not have discharged his duty as he
ought.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Love thrilled the chord of love in my soul’s lute,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And changed me all to love from head to foot.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas but a moment’s touch, yet shall Time ever</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To me the debt of thanksgiving impute.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is an axiom of the Sūfīs that what is
not <em>in</em> a man he cannot know. The gnostic&mdash;Man
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>&mdash;could not know God
and all the mysteries of the universe, unless
he found them in himself. He is the microcosm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span>
‘a copy made in the image of God,’
‘the eye of the world whereby God sees
His own works.’ In knowing himself as he
really is, he knows God, and he knows himself
through God, who is nearer to everything
than its knowledge of itself. Knowledge
of God precedes, and is the cause of, self-knowledge.</p>

<p>Gnosis, then, is unification, realisation of
the fact that the appearance of ‘otherness’
beside Oneness is a false and deluding
dream. Gnosis lays this spectre, which
haunts unenlightened men all their lives;
which rises, like a wall of utter darkness,
between them and God. Gnosis proclaims
that ‘I’ is a figure of speech, and that one
cannot truly refer any will, feeling, thought,
or action to one’s self.</p>

<p>Niffarī heard the divine voice saying to
him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When thou regardest thyself as
existent and dost not regard Me as the
Cause of thy existence, I veil My face
and thine own face appears to thee.
Therefore consider what is displayed
to thee, and what is hidden from
thee!”</p>

<p>[If a man regards himself as existing
through God, that which is of God in
him predominates over the phenomenal
element and makes it pass away, so that
he sees nothing but God. If, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span>
contrary, he regards himself as having an
independent existence, his unreal egoism
is displayed to him and the reality of
God becomes hidden from him.]</p>

<p>“Regard neither My displaying nor
that which is displayed, else thou wilt
laugh and weep; and when thou
laughest and weepest, thou art thine,
not Mine.”</p>

<p>[He who regards the act of divine
revelation is guilty of polytheism, since
revelation involves both a revealing
subject and a revealed object; and he
who regards the revealed object which
is part of the created universe, regards
something other than God. Laughter
signifies joy for what you have gained,
and weeping denotes grief for what you
have lost. Both are selfish actions.
The gnostic neither laughs nor weeps.]</p>

<p>“If thou dost not put behind thee
all that I have displayed and am displaying,
thou wilt not prosper; and
unless thou prosper, thou wilt not
become concentrated upon Me.”</p>

<p>[Prosperity is true belief in God,
which requires complete abstraction
from created things.]</p>
</div>

<p>Logically, these doctrines annul every
moral and religious law. In the gnostic’s
vision there are no divine rewards and
punishments, no human standards of right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span>
and wrong. For him, the written word
of God has been abrogated by a direct
and intimate revelation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not say,” exclaimed Abu
’l-Hasan Khurqānī, “that Paradise and
Hell are non-existent, but I say that they
are nothing to me, because God created
them both, and there is no room for any
created object in the place where I
am.”</p>
</div>

<p>From this standpoint all types of religion
are equal, and Islam is no better than
idolatry. It does not matter what creed a
man professes or what rites he performs.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The true mosque in a pure and holy heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is builded: there let all men worship God;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For there He dwells, not in a mosque of stone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Amidst all the variety of creeds and worshippers
the gnostic sees but one real object
of worship.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Those who adore God in the sun”
(says Ibn al-ʿArabī) “behold the sun,
and those who adore Him in living
things see a living thing, and those who
adore Him in lifeless things see a lifeless
thing, and those who adore Him
as a Being unique and unparalleled
see that which has no like. Do not
attach yourself” (he continues) “to any
particular creed exclusively, so that you
disbelieve in all the rest; otherwise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span>
you will lose much good, nay, you will
fail to recognise the real truth of the
matter. God, the omnipresent and
omnipotent, is not limited by any one
creed, for He says (Kor. <span class="bold">2.</span> 109),
‘Wheresoever ye turn, there is the face
of Allah.’ Every one praises what he
believes; his god is his own creature,
and in praising it he praises himself.
Consequently he blames the beliefs of
others, which he would not do if he were
just, but his dislike is based on ignorance.
If he knew Junayd’s saying,
‘The water takes its colour from the
vessel containing it,’ he would not interfere
with other men’s beliefs, but
would perceive God in every form of
belief.”</p>
</div>

<p>And Hafiz sings, more in the spirit of the
freethinker, perhaps, than of the mystic:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Love is where the glory falls</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Of Thy face&mdash;on convent walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Or on tavern floors, the same</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Unextinguishable flame.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Where the turbaned anchorite</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Chanteth Allah day and night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Church bells ring the call to prayer</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And the Cross of Christ is there.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sūfism may join hands with freethought&mdash;it
has often done so&mdash;but hardly ever with
sectarianism. This explains why the vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span>
majority of Sūfīs have been, at least nominally,
attached to the catholic body of the
Moslem community. ʿAbdallah Ansārī declared
that of two thousand Sūfī Sheykhs
with whom he was acquainted only two were
Shīʿites. A certain man who was a descendant
of the Caliph ʿAlī, and a fanatical
Shīʿite, tells the following story:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For five years,” he said, “my father
sent me daily to a spiritual director.
I learned one useful lesson from him:
he told me that I should never know
anything at all about Sūfism until I
got completely rid of the pride which
I felt on account of my lineage.”</p>
</div>

<p>Superficial observers have described
Bābism as an offshoot of Sūfism, but the
dogmatism of the one is naturally opposed
to the broad eclecticism of the other. In
proportion as the Sūfī gains more knowledge
of God, his religious prejudices are diminished.
Sheykh ʿAbd al-Rahīm ibn al-Sabbāgh, who
at first disliked living in Upper Egypt, with
its large Jewish and Christian population,
said in his old age that he would as readily embrace
a Jew or Christian as one of his own faith.</p>

<p>While the innumerable forms of creed and
ritual may be regarded as having a certain
relative value in so far as the inward feeling
which inspires them is ever one and the same,
from another aspect they seem to be veils
of the Truth, barriers which the zealous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span>
Unitarian must strive to abolish and
destroy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This world and that world are the egg, and the bird within it</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The great Persian mystic, Abū Saʿīd ibn
Abi ’l-Khayr, speaking in the name of the
Calendars or wandering dervishes, expresses
their iconoclastic principles with astonishing
boldness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Not until every mosque beneath the sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Lies ruined, will our holy work be done;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And never will true Musalmān appear</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Till faith and infidelity are one.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such open declarations of war against the
Mohammedan religion are exceptional. Notwithstanding
the breadth and depth of the
gulf between full-blown Sūfism and orthodox
Islam, many, if not most, Sūfīs have paid
homage to the Prophet and have observed
the outward forms of devotion which are
incumbent on all Moslems. They have
invested these rites and ceremonies with a
new meaning; they have allegorised them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>
but they have not abandoned them. Take
the pilgrimage, for example. In the eyes
of the genuine Sūfī it is null and void
unless each of the successive religious acts
which it involves is accompanied by corresponding
‘movements of the heart.’</p>

<p>A man who had just returned from the
pilgrimage came to Junayd. Junayd said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From the hour when you first journeyed
from your home have you also
been journeying away from all sins?”
He said “No.” “Then,” said Junayd,
“you have made no journey. At every
stage where you halted for the night
did you traverse a station on the way
to God?” “No,” he replied. “Then,”
said Junayd, “you have not trodden
the road, stage by stage. When you put
on the pilgrim’s garb at the proper place,
did you discard the qualities of human
nature as you cast off your clothes?”
“No.” “Then you have not put on
the pilgrim’s garb. When you stood at
ʿArafāt, did you stand one moment in
contemplation of God?” “No.” “Then
you have not stood at ʿArafāt. When
you went to Muzdalifa and achieved your
desire, did you renounce all sensual
desires?” “No.” “Then you have
not gone to Muzdalifa. When you
circumambulated the Kaʿba, did you
behold the immaterial beauty of God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span>
in the abode of purification?” “No.”
“Then you have not circumambulated
the Kaʿba. When you ran between
Safā and Marwa, did you attain to
purity (<i>safā</i>) and virtue (<i>muruwwat</i>)?”
“No.” “Then you have not run.
When you came to Minā, did all your
wishes (<i>munā</i>) cease?” “No.” “Then
you have not yet visited Minā. When
you reached the slaughter-place and
offered sacrifice, did you sacrifice the
objects of worldly desire?” “No.”
“Then you have not sacrificed. When
you threw the pebbles, did you throw
away whatever sensual thoughts were
accompanying you?” “No.” “Then
you have not yet thrown the pebbles,
and you have not yet performed the
pilgrimage.”</p>
</div>

<p>This anecdote contrasts the outer religious
law of theology with the inner spiritual truth
of mysticism, and shows that they should
not be divorced from each other.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Law without the Truth,” says
Hujwīrī, “is ostentation, and the Truth
without the Law is hypocrisy. Their
mutual relation may be compared to
that of body and spirit: when the spirit
departs from the body, the living body
becomes a corpse, and the spirit
vanishes like wind. The Moslem profession
of faith includes both: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span>
words, ‘There is no god but Allah,’ are the
Truth, and the words, ‘Mohammed is the
apostle of Allah,’ are the Law; any one
who denies the Truth is an infidel, and
any one who rejects the Law is a heretic.”</p>
</div>

<p>Middle ways, though proverbially safe, are
difficult to walk in; and only by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de
force</i> can the Koran be brought into line with
the esoteric doctrine which the Sūfīs derive
from it. Undoubtedly they have done a
great work for Islam. They have deepened
and enriched the lives of millions by ruthlessly
stripping off the husk of religion and
insisting that its kernel must be sought, not
in any formal act, but in cultivation of
spiritual feelings and in purification of the
inward man. This was a legitimate and
most fruitful development of the Prophet’s
teaching. But the Prophet was a strict
monotheist, while the Sūfīs, whatever they
may pretend or imagine, are theosophists,
pantheists, or monists. When they speak
and write as believers in the dogmas of
positive religion, they use language which
cannot be reconciled with such a theory of
unity as we are now examining. ʿAfīfuddīn
al-Tilimsānī, from whose commentary on
Niffarī I have given some extracts in this
chapter, said roundly that the whole Koran
is polytheism&mdash;a perfectly just statement
from the monistic point of view, though few
Sūfīs have dared to be so explicit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span></p>

<p>The mystic Unitarians admit the appearance
of contradiction, but deny its reality.
“The Law and the Truth” (they might say)
“are the same thing in different aspects.
The Law is for you, the Truth for us. In
addressing you we speak according to the
measure of your understanding, since what is
meat for gnostics is poison to the uninitiated,
and the highest mysteries ought to be
jealously guarded from profane ears. It is
only human reason that sees the single as
double, and balances the Law against the
Truth. Pass away from the world of
opposites and become one with God, who
has no opposite.”</p>

<p>The gnostic recognises that the Law is
valid and necessary in the moral sphere.
While good and evil remain, the Law stands
over both, commanding and forbidding,
rewarding and punishing. He knows, on
the other hand, that only God really exists
and acts: therefore, if evil really exists, it
must be divine, and if evil things are really
done, God must be the doer of them. The
conclusion is false because the hypothesis is
false. Evil has no real existence; it is not-being,
which is the privation and absence of
being, just as darkness is the absence of
light. “Once,” said Nūrī, “I beheld the
Light, and I fixed my gaze upon it until I
became the Light.” No wonder that such
illuminated souls, supremely indifferent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span>
the shadow-shows of religion and morality
in a phantom world, are ready to cry with
Jalāluddīn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The man of God is made wise by the Truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The man of God is not learned from book.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The man of God is beyond infidelity and faith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the man of God right and wrong are alike.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It must be borne in mind that this is a
theory of perfection, and that those whom it
exalts above the Law are saints, spiritual
guides, and profound theosophists who enjoy
the special favour of God and presumably
do not need to be restrained, coerced, or
punished. In practice, of course, it leads
in many instances to antinomianism and
libertinism, as among the Bektāshīs and
other orders of the so-called ‘lawless’
dervishes. The same theories produced the
same results in Europe during the Middle
Ages, and the impartial historian cannot
ignore the corruptions to which a purely
subjective mysticism is liable; but
on the present occasion we are concerned
with the rose itself, not with its
cankers.</p>

<p>Not all Sūfīs are gnostics; and, as I have
mentioned before, those who are not yet ripe
for the gnosis receive from their gnostic
teachers the ethical instruction suitable to
their needs. Jalāluddīn Rūmī, in his collection
of lyrical poems entitled <cite>The Dīvān<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>
of Shamsi Tabrīz</cite>, gives free rein to a pantheistic
enthusiasm which sees all things
under the form of eternity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have put duality away, I have seen that the two worlds are one;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One I seek, One I know, One I see, One I call.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am intoxicated with Love’s cup, the two worlds have passed out of my ken;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have no business save carouse and revelry.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But in his <cite>Masnavī</cite>&mdash;a work so famous and
venerated that it has been styled ‘The Koran
of Persia’&mdash;we find him in a more sober
mood expounding the Sūfī doctrines and
justifying the ways of God to man. Here,
though he is a convinced optimist and agrees
with Ghazālī that this is the best of all
possible worlds, he does not airily dismiss the
problem of evil as something outside reality,
but endeavours to show that evil, or what
seems evil to us, is part of the divine order
and harmony. I will quote some passages of
his argument and leave my readers to judge
how far it is successful or, at any rate,
suggestive.</p>

<p>The Sūfīs, it will be remembered, conceive
the universe as a projected and reflected image
of God. The divine light, streaming forth
in a series of emanations, falls at last upon
the darkness of not-being, every atom of which
reflects some attribute of Deity. For instance,
the beautiful attributes of love and mercy
are reflected in the form of heaven and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span>
angels, while the terrible attributes of wrath
and vengeance are reflected in the form of
hell and the devils. Man reflects all the
attributes, the terrible as well as the
beautiful: he is an epitome of heaven and
hell. Omar Khayyām alludes to this theory
when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Hell is a spark from our fruitless pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Heaven a breath from our time of joy”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="noindent">
<p>&mdash;a couplet which <a id="TN3">FitzGerald</a> moulded into
the magnificent stanza:</p>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Heav’n but the Vision of fulfilled Desire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jalāluddīn, therefore, does in a sense make
God the author of evil, but at the same time
he makes evil intrinsically good in relation
to God&mdash;for it is the reflexion of certain
divine attributes which in themselves are
absolutely good. So far as evil is really evil,
it springs from not-being. The poet assigns
a different value to this term in its relation to
God and in its relation to man. In respect
of God not-being is nothing, for God is real
Being, but in man it is the principle of evil
which constitutes half of human nature. In
the one case it is a pure negation, in the
other it is positively and actively pernicious.
We need not quarrel with the poet for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span>
coming to grief in his logic. There are
some occasions when intense moral feeling
is worth any amount of accurate thinking.</p>

<p>It is evident that the doctrine of divine
unity implies predestination. Where God
is and naught beside Him, there can be no
other agent than He, no act but His. “Thou
didst not throw, when thou threwest, but
God threw” (Kor. <span class="bold">8.</span> 17). Compulsion is
felt only by those who do not love. To know
God is to love Him; and the gnostic may
answer, like the dervish who was asked
how he fared:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I fare as one by whose majestic will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The world revolves, floods rise and rivers flow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stars in their courses move; yea, death and life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hang on his nod and fly to the ends of earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His ministers of mourning or of joy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is the Truth; but for the benefit of
such as cannot bear it, Jalāluddīn vindicates
the justice of God by asserting that men have
the power to choose how they will act, although
their freedom is subordinate to the
divine will. Approaching the question, “Why
does God ordain and create evil?” he points
out that things are known through their
opposites, and that the existence of evil is
necessary for the manifestation of good.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Not-being and defect, wherever seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are mirrors of the beauty of all that is.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bone-setter, where should he try his skill</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But on the patient lying with broken leg?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were no base copper in the crucible,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How could the alchemist his craft display?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Moreover, the divine omnipotence would
not be completely realised if evil had remained
uncreated.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He is the source of evil, as thou sayest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet evil hurts Him not. To make that evil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Denotes in Him perfection. Hear from me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A parable. The heavenly Artist paints</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beautiful shapes and ugly: in one picture</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The loveliest women in the land of Egypt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gazing on youthful Joseph amorously;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lo, another scene by the same hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hell-fire and Iblīs with his hideous crew:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Both master-works, created for good ends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To show His perfect wisdom and confound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sceptics who deny His mastery.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could He not evil make, He would lack skill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore He fashions infidel alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Moslem true, that both may witness bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Him, and worship One Almighty Lord.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In reply to the objection that a God who
creates evil must Himself be evil, Jalāluddīn,
pursuing the analogy drawn from Art,
remarks that ugliness in the picture is no
evidence of ugliness in the painter.</p>

<p>Again, without evil it would be impossible
to win the proved virtue which is the reward
of self-conquest. Bread must be broken
before it can serve as food, and grapes will
not yield wine till they are crushed. Many
men are led through tribulation to happiness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>
As evil ebbs, good flows. Finally, much evil is
only apparent. What seems a curse to one
may be a blessing to another; nay, evil
itself is turned to good for the righteous.
Jalāluddīn will not admit that anything is
absolutely bad.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fools buy false coins because they are like the true.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If in the world no genuine minted coin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were current, how would forgers pass the false?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Falsehood were nothing unless truth were there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make it specious. ’Tis the love of right</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">One true fakīr. Search well and thou wilt find!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Surely this is a noteworthy doctrine.
Jalāluddīn died only a few years after the
birth of Dante, but the Christian poet falls
far below the level of charity and tolerance
reached by his Moslem contemporary.</p>

<p>How is it possible to discern the soul of
goodness in things evil? By means of love,
says Jalāluddīn, and the knowledge which
love alone can give, according to the word
of God in the holy Tradition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My servant draws nigh unto Me, and
I love him; and when I love him, I am
his ear, so that he hears by Me, and his
eye, so that he sees by Me, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span>
tongue, so that he speaks by Me, and his
hand, so that he takes by Me.”</p>
</div>

<p>Although it will be convenient to treat of
mystical love in a separate chapter, the
reader must not fancy that a new subject is
opening before him. Gnosis and love are
spiritually identical; they teach the same
truths in different language.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="smcap">Any</span> one acquainted, however slightly, with
the mystical poetry of Islam must have
remarked that the aspiration of the soul
towards God is expressed, as a rule, in almost
the same terms which might be used by
an Oriental Anacreon or Herrick. The resemblance,
indeed, is often so close that,
unless we have some clue to the poet’s
intention, we are left in doubt as to his
meaning. In some cases, perhaps, the ambiguity
serves an artistic purpose, as in the
odes of Hafiz, but even when the poet is not
deliberately keeping his readers suspended
between earth and heaven, it is quite easy to
mistake a mystical hymn for a drinking-song
or a serenade. Ibn al-ʿArabī, the greatest
theosophist whom the Arabs have produced,
found himself obliged to write a commentary
on some of his poems in order to refute the
scandalous charge that they were designed to
celebrate the charms of his mistress. Here
are a few lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, her beauty&mdash;the tender maid! Its brilliance gives light like lamps to one travelling in the dark.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is a pearl hidden in a shell of hair as black as jet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A pearl for which Thought dives and remains unceasingly in the deeps of that ocean.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He who looks upon her deems her to be a gazelle of the sand-hills, because of her shapely neck and the loveliness of her gestures.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has been said that the Sūfīs invented
this figurative style as a mask for mysteries
which they desired to keep secret. That
desire was natural in those who proudly
claimed to possess an esoteric doctrine
known only to themselves; moreover, a
plain statement of what they believed might
have endangered their liberties, if not their
lives. But, apart from any such motives, the
Sūfīs adopt the symbolic style because there
is no other possible way of interpreting
mystical experience. So little does knowledge
of the infinite revealed in ecstatic vision
need an artificial disguise that it cannot be
communicated at all except through types
and emblems drawn from the sensible world,
which, imperfect as they are, may suggest
and shadow forth a deeper meaning than
appears on the surface. “Gnostics,” says
Ibn al-ʿArabī, “cannot impart their feelings
to other men; they can only indicate them
symbolically to those who have begun to
experience the like.” What kind of symbolism
each mystic will prefer depends on
his temperament and character. If he be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span>
religious artist, a spiritual poet, his ideas of
reality are likely to clothe themselves instinctively
in forms of beauty and glowing
images of human love. To him the rosy
cheek of the beloved represents the divine
essence manifested through its attributes;
her dark curls signify the One veiled by the
Many; when he says, “Drink wine that it
may set you free from yourself,” he means,
“Lose your phenomenal self in the rapture
of divine contemplation.” I might fill pages
with further examples.</p>

<p>This erotic and bacchanalian symbolism
is not, of course, peculiar to the mystical
poetry of Islam, but nowhere else is it displayed
so opulently and in such perfection.
It has often been misunderstood by European
critics, one of whom even now can
describe the ecstasies of the Sūfīs as “inspired
partly by wine and strongly tinged
with sensuality.” As regards the whole
body of Sūfīs, the charge is altogether false.
No intelligent and unprejudiced student
of their writings could have made it, and
we ought to have been informed on what
sort of evidence it is based. There are black
sheep in every flock, and amongst the Sūfīs
we find many hypocrites, debauchees, and
drunkards who bring discredit on the pure
brethren. But it is just as unfair to judge
Sūfism in general by the excesses of these
impostors as it would be to condemn all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span>
Christian mysticism on the ground that
certain sects and individuals are immoral.</p>

  </div>

<p>said Jalāluddīn. Ibn al-ʿArabī declares

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Commenting on the last verse, the poet
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Love, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quâ</i> love, is one and the same
reality to those Arab lovers and to me;
but the objects of our love are different,
for they loved a phenomenon, whereas I
love the Real. They are a pattern to
us, because God only afflicted them with
love for human beings in order that He
might show, by means of them, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>
falseness of those who pretend to love
Him, and yet feel no such transport and
rapture in loving Him as deprived those
enamoured men of their reason, and
made them unconscious of themselves.”</p>
</div>

<p>Most of the great medieval Sūfīs lived
saintly lives, dreaming of God, intoxicated
with God. When they tried to tell their
dreams, being men, they used the language
of men. If they were also literary artists,
they naturally wrote in the style of their own
day and generation. In mystical poetry the
Arabs yield the palm to the Persians. Any
one who would read the secret of Sūfism, no
longer encumbered with theological articles
nor obscured by metaphysical subtleties&mdash;let
him turn to ʿAttār, Jalāluddīn Rūmī, and
Jāmī, whose works are partially accessible
in English and other European languages.
To translate these wonderful hymns is to
break their melody and bring their soaring
passion down to earth, but not even a prose
translation can quite conceal the love of
Truth and the vision of Beauty which inspired
them. Listen again to Jalāluddīn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He comes, a moon whose like the sky ne’er saw, awake or dreaming,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Crowned with eternal flame no flood can lay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo, from the flagon of Thy love, O Lord, my soul is swimming,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And ruined all my body’s house of clay.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">When first the Giver of the grape my lonely heart befriended,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Wine fired my bosom and my veins filled up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when His image all mine eye possessed, a voice descended,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">‘Well done, O sovereign Wine and peerless Cup!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The love thus symbolised is the emotional
element in religion, the rapture of the seer,
the courage of the martyr, the faith of the
saint, the only basis of moral perfection and
spiritual knowledge. Practically, it is self-renunciation
and self-sacrifice, the giving up
of all possessions&mdash;wealth, honour, will, life,
and whatever else men value&mdash;for the Beloved’s
sake without any thought of reward.
I have already referred to love as the supreme
principle in Sūfī ethics, and now let me give
some illustrations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Love,” says Jalāluddīn, “is the
remedy of our pride and self-conceit,
the physician of all our infirmities.
Only he whose garment is rent by love
becomes entirely unselfish.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nūrī, Raqqām, and other Sūfīs were
accused of heresy and sentenced to death.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the executioner approached
Raqqām, Nūrī rose and offered himself
in his friend’s place with the utmost
cheerfulness and submission. All the
spectators were astounded. The executioner
said, ‘Young man, the sword
is not a thing that people are so eager to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>
meet; and your turn has not yet
arrived.’ Nūrī answered, ‘My religion
is founded on unselfishness. Life is the
most precious thing in the world: I
wish to sacrifice for my brethren’s sake
the few moments which remain.’”</p>
</div>

<p>On another occasion Nūrī was overheard
praying as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“O Lord, in Thy eternal knowledge
and power and will Thou dost punish
the people of Hell whom Thou hast
created; and if it be Thy inexorable
will to make Hell full of mankind, Thou
art able to fill it with me alone, and to
send them to Paradise.”</p>
</div>

<p>In proportion as the Sūfī loves God, he sees
God in all His creatures, and goes forth to
them in acts of charity. Pious works are
naught without love.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cheer one sad heart: thy loving deed will be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More than a thousand temples raised by thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One freeman whom thy kindness hath enslaved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Outweighs by far a thousand slaves set free.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Moslem <cite>Legend of the Saints</cite> abounds in
tales of pity shown to animals (including the
despised dog), birds, and even insects. It is related
that Bāyazīd purchased some cardamom
seed at Hamadhān, and before departing put
into his gaberdine a small quantity which
was left over. On reaching Bistām and recollecting
what he had done, he took out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span>
seed and found that it contained a number of
ants. Saying, “I have carried the poor
creatures away from their home,” he immediately
set off and journeyed back to Hamadhān&mdash;a
distance of several hundred miles.</p>

<p>This universal charity is one of the fruits
of pantheism. The ascetic view of the world
which prevailed amongst the early Sūfīs, and
their vivid consciousness of God as a transcendent
Personality rather than as an immanent
Spirit, caused them to crush their
human affections relentlessly. Here is a short
story from the life of Fudayl ibn ʿIyād. It
would be touching if it were not so edifying.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One day he had in his lap a child
four years old, and chanced to give it a
kiss, as is the way of fathers. The child
said, ‘Father, do you love me?’ ‘Yes,’
said Fudayl. ‘Do you love God?’
‘Yes.’ ‘How many hearts have you?’
‘One.’ ‘Then,’ asked the child, ‘how
can you love two with one heart?’
Fudayl perceived that the child’s words
were a divine admonition. In his zeal
for God he began to beat his head and
repented of his love for the child, and
gave his heart wholly to God.”</p>
</div>

<p>The higher Sūfī mysticism, as represented
by Jalāluddīn Rūmī, teaches that the
phenomenal is a bridge to the Real.</p>

<p>Emerson sums up the meaning of this
where he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Beholding in many souls the traits
of the divine beauty, and separating in
each soul that which is divine from the
taint which it has contracted in the
world, the lover ascends to the highest
beauty, to the love and knowledge of
the Divinity, by steps on this ladder of
created souls.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Man’s love of God,” says Hujwīrī,
“is a quality which manifests itself,
in the heart of the pious believer, in the
form of veneration and magnification,
so that he seeks to satisfy his Beloved
and becomes impatient and restless in
his desire for vision of Him, and cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span>
rest with any one except Him, and
grows familiar with the recollection of
Him, and abjures the recollection of
everything besides. Repose becomes unlawful
to him, and rest flees from him.
He is cut off from all habits and associations,
and renounces sensual passion, and
turns towards the court of love, and
submits to the law of love, and knows
God by His attributes of perfection.”</p>
</div>

<p>Inevitably such a man will love his fellow-men.
Whatever cruelty they inflict upon
him, he will perceive only the chastening
hand of God, “whose bitters are very
sweets to the soul.” Bāyazīd said that
when God loves a man, He endows him
with three qualities in token thereof: a
bounty like that of the sea, a sympathy like
that of the sun, and a humility like that of
the earth. No suffering can be too great,
no devotion too high, for the piercing insight
and burning faith of a true lover.</p>

<p>Ibn al-ʿArabī claims that Islam is peculiarly
the religion of love, inasmuch as the
Prophet Mohammed is called God’s beloved
(<i>Habīb</i>), but though some traces of this
doctrine occur in the Koran, its main impulse
was unquestionably derived from Christianity.
While the oldest Sūfī literature, which
is written in Arabic and unfortunately has
come down to us in a fragmentary state, is
still dominated by the Koranic insistence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span>
on fear of Allah, it also bears conspicuous
marks of the opposing Christian tradition.
As in Christianity, through Dionysius and
other writers of the Neoplatonic school, so
in Islam, and probably under the same influence,
the devotional and mystical love of
God soon developed into ecstasy and enthusiasm
which finds in the sensuous imagery
of human love the most suggestive medium
for its expression. Dr. Inge observes that
the Sūfīs “appear, like true Asiatics, to
have attempted to give a sacramental and
symbolic character to the indulgence of
their passions.” I need not again point out
that such a view of genuine Sūfism is both
superficial and incorrect.</p>

<p>Love, like gnosis, is in its essence a divine
gift, not anything that can be acquired. “If
the whole world wished to attract love, they
could not; and if they made the utmost
efforts to repel it, they could not.” Those
who love God are those whom God loves.
“I fancied that I loved Him,” said Bāyazīd,
“but on consideration I saw that His love
preceded mine.” Junayd defined love as
the substitution of the qualities of the
Beloved for the qualities of the lover. In
other words, love signifies the passing-away
of the individual self; it is an uncontrollable
rapture, a God-sent grace which
must be sought by ardent prayer and
aspiration.</p>

<p>Jalāluddīn teaches that man’s love is
really the effect of God’s love by means of an
apologue. One night a certain devotee was
praying aloud, when Satan appeared to him
and said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How long wilt thou cry, ‘O Allah’?
Be quiet, for thou wilt get no answer.”
The devotee hung his head in silence.
After a little while he had a vision of
the prophet Khadir, who said to him,
“Ah, why hast thou ceased to call on
God?” “Because the answer ‘Here
am I’ came not,” he replied. Khadir
said, “God hath ordered me to go to
thee and say this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Divine love is beyond description, yet its
signs are manifest. Sarī al-Saqatī questioned
Junayd concerning the nature of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some say,” he answered, “that it
is a state of concord, and some say that
it is altruism, and some say that it is
so-and-so.” Sarī took hold of the skin
on his forearm and pulled it, but it
would not stretch; then he said, “I
swear by the glory of God, were I to say
that this skin hath shrivelled on this
bone for love of Him, I should be telling
the truth.” Thereupon he fainted
away, and his face became like a shining
moon.</p>
</div>

<p>Love, ‘the astrolabe of heavenly mysteries,’
inspires all religion worthy of the name, and
brings with it, not reasoned belief, but the
intense conviction arising from immediate
intuition. This inner light is its own evidence;
he who sees it has real knowledge,
and nothing can increase or diminish his
certainty. Hence the Sūfīs never weary of
exposing the futility of a faith which supports
itself on intellectual proofs, external
authority, self-interest, or self-regard of any
kind. The barren dialectic of the theologian;
the canting righteousness of the Pharisee
rooted in forms and ceremonies; the less
crude but equally undisinterested worship
of which the motive is desire to gain everlasting
happiness in the life hereafter;
the relatively pure devotion of the mystic
who, although he loves God, yet thinks of
himself as loving, and whose heart is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span>
wholly emptied of ‘otherness’&mdash;all these
are ‘veils’ to be removed.</p>

<p>A few sayings by those who know will be
more instructive than further explanation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“O God! whatever share of this
world Thou hast allotted to me, bestow
it on Thine enemies; and whatever
share of the next world Thou hast
allotted to me, bestow it on Thy friends.
Thou art enough for me.” (<span class="smcap">Rābiʿa.</span>)</p>

<p>“O God! if I worship Thee in fear
of Hell, burn me in Hell; and if I
worship Thee in hope of Paradise,
exclude me from Paradise; but if I
worship Thee for Thine own sake,
withhold not Thine everlasting beauty!”
(<span class="smcap">Rābiʿa.</span>)</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding that the lovers of
God are separated from Him by their
love, they have the essential thing, for
whether they sleep or wake, they seek
and are sought, and are not occupied
with their own seeking and loving, but
are enraptured in contemplation of the
Beloved. It is a crime in the lover to
regard his love, and an outrage in love
to look at one’s own seeking while one is
face to face with the Sought.” (<span class="smcap">Bāyazīd.</span>)</p>

<p>“His love entered and removed all
besides Him and left no trace of anything
else, so that it remained single
even as He is single.” (<span class="smcap">Bāyazīd.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span></p>

<p>“To feel at one with God for a moment
is better than all men’s acts of worship
from the beginning to the end of the
world.” (<span class="smcap">Shiblī.</span>)</p>

<p>Love, again, is the divine instinct of the
soul impelling it to realise its nature and
destiny. The soul is the first-born of God:
before the creation of the universe it lived
and moved and had its being in Him, and
during its earthly manifestation it is a
stranger in exile, ever pining to return to
its home.</p>

<p>All the love-romances and allegories of
Sūfī poetry&mdash;the tales of Laylā and Majnūn,
Yūsuf (Joseph) and Zulaykhā, Salāmān and
Absāl, the Moth and the Candle, the Nightingale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>
and the Rose&mdash;are shadow-pictures
of the soul’s passionate longing to be reunited
with God. It is impossible, in the
brief space at my command, to give the
reader more than a passing glimpse of the
treasures which the exuberant fancy of the
East has heaped together in every room of
this enchanted palace. The soul is likened
to a moaning dove that has lost her mate;
to a reed torn from its bed and made into
a flute whose plaintive music fills the eye
with tears; to a falcon summoned by the
fowler’s whistle to perch again upon his
wrist; to snow melting in the sun and
mounting as vapour to the sky; to a frenzied
camel swiftly plunging through the desert
by night; to a caged parrot, a fish on
dry land, a pawn that seeks to become a
king.</p>

<p>These figures imply that God is conceived
as transcendent, and that the soul cannot
reach Him without taking what Plotinus
in a splendid phrase calls “the flight of
the Alone to the Alone.” Jalāluddīn says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The motion of every atom is towards its origin;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A man comes to be the thing on which he is bent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the attraction of fondness and yearning, the soul and the heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assume the qualities of the Beloved, who is the Soul of souls.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘A man comes to be the thing on which
he is bent’: what, then, does the Sūfī<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span>
become? Eckhart in one of his sermons
quotes the saying of St. Augustine that
Man <em>is</em> what he loves, and adds this comment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If he loves a stone, he is a stone;
if he loves a man, he is a man; if he
loves God&mdash;I dare not say more, for if
I said that he would then be God, ye
might stone me.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Moslem mystics enjoyed greater
freedom of speech than their Christian
brethren who owed allegiance to the medieval
Catholic Church, and if they went too far
the plea of ecstasy was generally accepted
as a sufficient excuse. Whether they emphasise
the outward or the inward aspect
of unification, the transcendence or the
immanence of God, their expressions are
bold and uncompromising. Thus Abū Saʿīd:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In my heart Thou dwellest&mdash;else with blood I’ll drench it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In mine eye Thou glowest&mdash;else with tears I’ll quench it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only to be one with Thee my soul desireth&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Else from out my body, by hook or crook, I’ll wrench it!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jalāluddīn Rūmī proclaims that the soul’s
love of God is God’s love of the soul, and
that in loving the soul God loves Himself,
for He draws home to Himself that which
in its essence is divine.</p>

<p>“Our copper,” says the poet, “has
been transmuted by this rare alchemy,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span>
meaning that the base alloy of self has
been purified and spiritualised. In another
ode he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O my soul, I searched from end to end: I saw in thee naught save the Beloved;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call me not infidel, O my soul, if I say that thou thyself art He.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And yet more plainly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ye who in search of God, of God, pursue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye need not search for God is you, is you!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why seek ye something that was missing ne’er?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save you none is, but you are&mdash;where, oh, where?”</div>

<p>The Sūfīs have always declared and believed
themselves to be God’s chosen people.
The Koran refers in several places to His
elect. According to the author of the <cite>Kitāb
al-Lumaʿ</cite>, this title belongs, firstly, to the
prophets, elect in virtue of their sinlessness,
their inspiration, and their apostolic mission;
and secondly, to certain Moslems, elect in
virtue of their sincere devotion and self-mortification
and firm attachment to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span>
eternal realities: in a word, the saints.
While the Sūfīs are the elect of the
Moslem community, the saints are the elect
of the Sūfīs.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan saint is commonly
known as a <i>walī</i> (plural, <i>awliyā</i>). This
word is used in various senses derived from
its root-meaning of ‘nearness’; <i><abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr></i> next
of kin, patron, protector, friend. It is applied
in the Koran to God as the protector
of the Faithful, to angels or idols who are
supposed to protect their worshippers, and
to men who are regarded as being specially
under divine protection. Mohammed twits
the Jews with professing to be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</i> of
God (<i>awliyā lillāh</i>). Notwithstanding its
somewhat equivocal associations, the term
was taken over by the Sūfīs and became the
ordinary designation of persons whose holiness
brings them near to God, and who
receive from Him, as tokens of His peculiar
favour, miraculous gifts (<i>karāmāt</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαρίσματα</span>);
they are His friends, on whom “no fear shall
come and they shall not grieve”;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> any
injury done to them is an act of hostility
against Him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Kor. <span class="bold">10.</span> 63.</p>

</div>

<p>The inspiration of the Islamic saints,
though verbally distinguished from that of
the prophets and inferior in degree, is of the
same kind. In consequence of their intimate
relation to God, the veil shrouding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>
supernatural, or, as a Moslem would say,
the unseen world, from their perceptions
is withdrawn at intervals, and in their fits
of ecstasy they rise to the prophetic level.
Neither deep learning in divinity, nor devotion
to good works, nor asceticism, nor
moral purity makes the Mohammedan a
saint; he may have all or none of these
things, but the only indispensable qualification
is that ecstasy and rapture which is the
outward sign of ‘passing-away’ from the
phenomenal self. Any one thus enraptured
(<i>majdhūb</i>) is a <i>walī</i>,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and when such persons
are recognised through their power of working
miracles, they are venerated as saints
not only after death but also during their
lives. Often, however, they live and die in
obscurity. Hujwīrī tells us that amongst
the saints “there are four thousand who
are concealed and do not know one another
and are not aware of the excellence of their
state, being in all circumstances hidden from
themselves and from mankind.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> <i>Waliyyat</i>, if the saint is a woman.</p>

</div>

<p>The saints form an invisible hierarchy, on
which the order of the world is thought to
depend. Its supreme head is entitled the
<i>Qutb</i> (Axis). He is the most eminent Sūfī
of his age, and presides over the meetings
regularly held by this august parliament,
whose members are not hampered in their
attendance by the inconvenient fictions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span>
time and space, but come together from all
parts of the earth in the twinkling of an eye,
traversing seas and mountains and deserts
as easily as common mortals step across a
road. Below the <i>Qutb</i> stand various classes
and grades of sanctity. Hujwīrī enumerates
them, in ascending series, as follows: three
hundred <i>Akhyār</i> (Good), forty <i>Abdāl</i>
(Substitutes), seven <i>Abrār</i> (Pious), four
<i>Awtād</i> (Supports), and three <i>Nuqabā</i> (Overseers).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All these know one another and
cannot act save by mutual consent. It
is the task of the <i>Awtād</i> to go round the
whole world every night, and if there
should be any place on which their eyes
have not fallen, next day some flaw
will appear in that place, and they must
then inform the <i>Qutb</i> in order that he
may direct his attention to the weak
spot and that by his blessing the imperfection
may be remedied.”</p>
</div>

<p>We are studying in this book the mystical
life of the individual Moslem, and it is
necessary to keep the subject within the
narrowest bounds. Otherwise, I should have
liked to dwell on the external and historical
organisation of Sūfism as a school for saints,
and to describe the process of evolution
through which the <i>walī</i> privately conversing
with a small circle of friends became, first,
a teacher and spiritual guide gathering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span>
disciples around him during his lifetime,
and finally the head of a perpetual religious
order which bore his name. The earliest
of these great fraternities date from the
twelfth century. In addition to their own
members&mdash;the so-called ‘dervishes’&mdash;each
order has a large number of lay brethren
attached to it, so that their influence pervades
all ranks of Moslem society. They
are “independent and self-developing.
There is rivalry between them; but no one
rules over the other. In faith and practice
each goes its own way, limited only by the
universal conscience of Islam. Thus strange
doctrines and grave moral defects easily
develop unheeded, but freedom is saved.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Of course, the typical <i>walī</i> is incapable of
founding an order, but Islam has produced
no less frequently than Christendom men
who combine intense spiritual illumination
with creative energy and aptitude for affairs
on a grand scale. The Mohammedan notion
of the saint as a person possessed by God
allows a very wide application of the term:
in popular usage it extends from the greatest
Sūfī theosophists, like Jalāluddīn Rūmī and
Ibn al-ʿArabī, down to those who have
gained sanctity only by losing sanity&mdash;victims
of epilepsy and hysteria, half-witted
idiots and harmless lunatics.</p>

<p>Both Qushayrī<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and Hujwīrī discuss the
question whether a saint can be conscious
of his saintship, and answer it in the affirmative.
Their opponents argue that consciousness
of saintship involves assurance of salvation,
which is impossible, since no one
can know with certainty that he shall be
among the saved on the Day of Judgment.
In reply it was urged that God may miraculously
assure the saint of his predestined
salvation, while maintaining him in a state
of spiritual soundness and preserving him
from disobedience. The saint is not immaculate,
as the prophets are, but the
divine protection which he enjoys is a
guarantee that he will not persevere in evil
courses, though he may temporarily be led
astray. According to the view generally
held, saintship depends on faith, not on
conduct, so that no sin except infidelity
can cause it to be forfeited. This perilous
theory, which opens the door to antinomianism,
was mitigated by the emphasis laid
on fulfilment of the religious law. The
following anecdote of Bāyazīd al-Bistāmī
shows the official attitude of all the leading
Sūfīs who are cited as authorities in the
Moslem text-books.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> Author of a famous work designed to close the breach
between Sūfism and Islam. He died in 1074 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was told (he said) that a saint of
God was living in such-and-such a town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span>
and I set out to visit him. When I
entered the mosque, he came forth from
his chamber and spat on the floor.
I turned back without saluting him,
saying to myself, ‘A saint must keep
the religious law in order that God may
keep him in his spiritual state. Had
this man been a saint, his respect for
the law would have prevented him from
spitting on the floor, or God would have
saved him from marring the grace
<a id="TN4">vouchsafed to him.</a>’”</p>
</div>

<p>Many <i>walīs</i>, however, regard the law as a
curb that is indeed necessary so long as one
remains in the disciplinary stage, but may
be discarded by the saint. Such a person,
they declare, stands on a higher plane than
ordinary men, and is not to be condemned
for actions which outwardly seem irreligious.
While the older Sūfīs insist that a <i>walī</i> who
breaks the law is thereby shown to be an
impostor, the popular belief in the saints and
the rapid growth of saint-worship tended to
aggrandise the <i>walī</i> at the expense of the law,
and to foster the conviction that a divinely
gifted man can do no wrong, or at least that
his actions must not be judged by appearances.
The classical instance of this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus
divinum</i> vested in the friends of God is the
story of Moses and Khadir, which is related
in the Koran (<span class="bold">18.</span> 64-80). Khadir or Khizr&mdash;the
Koran does not mention him by name&mdash;is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span>
a mysterious sage endowed with immortality,
who is said to enter into conversation
with wandering Sūfīs and impart
to them his God-given knowledge. Moses
desired to accompany him on a journey
that he might profit by his teaching, and
Khadir consented, only stipulating that
Moses should ask no questions of him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So they both went on, till they
embarked in a boat and he (Khadir)
staved it in. ‘What!’ cried Moses,
‘hast thou staved it in that thou
mayst drown its crew? Verily, a
strange thing hast thou done.’</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Did not I tell thee that
thou couldst no way have patience with
me?’</p>

<p>“Then they went on until they met a
youth, and he slew him. Said Moses,
‘Hast thou slain him who is free from
guilt of blood? Surely now thou hast
wrought an unheard-of thing!’”</p>
</div>

<p>After Moses had broken his promise of
silence for the third time, Khadir resolved
to leave him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But first,” he said, “I will tell thee
the meaning of that with which thou
couldst not have patience. As to the
boat, it belonged to poor men, toilers
on the sea, and I was minded to damage
it, for in their rear was a king who
seized on every boat by force. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span>
as to the youth, his parents were
believers, and I feared lest he should
trouble them by error and unbelief.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Sūfīs are fond of quoting this unimpeachable
testimony that the <i>walī</i>
is above human criticism, and that his
hand, as Jalāluddīn asserts, is even as the
hand of God. Most Moslems admit the
claim to be valid in so far as they shrink
from applying conventional standards of
morality to holy men. I have explained
its metaphysical justification in <a href="#Chapter_5" title="Go to Chapter 5">an earlier
chapter.</a></p>

<p>A miracle performed by a saint is termed
<i><a id="TN5">karāmāt</a></i>, <i>i.e.</i> a ‘favour’ which God bestows
upon him, whereas a miracle performed by a
prophet is called <i>muʿjizat</i>, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> an act which
cannot be imitated by any one. The distinction
originated in controversy, and was
used to answer those who held the miraculous
powers of the saints to be a grave encroachment
on the prerogative of the Prophet.
Sūfī apologists, while confessing that both
kinds of miracle are substantially the same,
take pains to differentiate the characteristics
of each; they declare, moreover, that the
saints are the Prophet’s witnesses, and that
all their miracles (like ‘a drop trickling
from a full skin of honey’) are in reality
derived from him. This is the orthodox
view and is supported by those Mohammedan
mystics who acknowledge the Law as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span>
as the Truth, though in some cases it may
have amounted to little more than a pious
opinion. We have often noticed the difficulty
in which the Sūfīs find themselves when
they try to make a logical compromise with
Islam. But the word ‘logic’ is very misleading
in this connexion. The beginning
of wisdom, for European students of Oriental
religion, lies in the discovery that incongruous
beliefs&mdash;I mean, of course, beliefs
which <em>our</em> minds cannot harmonise&mdash;dwell
peacefully together in the Oriental brain;
that their owner is quite unconscious of
their incongruity; and that, as a rule, he
is absolutely sincere. Contradictions which
seem glaring to us do not trouble him at all.</p>

<p>The thaumaturgic element in ancient
Sūfism was not so important as it afterwards
became in the fully developed saint-worship
associated with the Dervish Orders. “A
saint would be none the less a saint,” says
Qushayrī, “if no miracles were wrought by
him in this world.” In early Mohammedan
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitæ Sanctorum</i> it is not uncommon to
meet with sayings to the effect that miraculous
powers are comparatively of small
account. It was finely said by Sahl ibn
ʿAbdallah that the greatest miracle is the
substitution of a good quality for a bad
one; and the <cite>Kitāb al-Lumaʿ</cite> gives many
examples of holy men who disliked miracles
and regarded them as a temptation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span>
“During my novitiate,” said Bāyazīd,
“God used to bring before me wonders and
miracles, but I paid no heed to them; and
when He saw that I did so, He gave me the
means of attaining to knowledge of Himself.”
Junayd observed that reliance on miracles
is one of the ‘veils’ which hinder the elect
from penetrating to the inmost shrine of the
Truth. This was too high doctrine for the
great mass of Moslems, and in the end
the vulgar idea of saintship triumphed
over the mystical and theosophical conception.
All such warnings and scruples
were swept aside by the same irresistible
instinct which rendered vain the solemn
asseverations of Mohammed that there was
nothing supernatural about him, and which
transformed the human Prophet of history
into an omnipotent hierophant and magician.
The popular demand for miracles far exceeded
the supply, but where the <i>walīs</i>
failed, a vivid and credulous imagination
came to their rescue and represented them,
not as they were, but as they ought to be.
Year by year the <cite>Legend of the Saints</cite>
grew more glorious and wonderful as it
continued to draw fresh tribute from the
unfathomable ocean of Oriental romance.
The pretensions made by the <i>walīs</i>, or on
their behalf, steadily increased, and the
stories told of them were ever becoming more
fantastic and extravagant. I will devote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span>
the remainder of this chapter to a sketch
of the <i>walī</i> as he appears in the vast medieval
literature on the subject.</p>

<p>The Moslem saint does not say that he has
wrought a miracle; he says, “a miracle was
granted or manifested to me.” According
to one view, he may be fully conscious at
the time, but many Sūfīs hold that such
‘manifestation’ cannot take place except
in ecstasy, when the saint is entirely under
divine control. His own personality is then
in abeyance, and those who interfere with
him oppose the Almighty Power which speaks
with his lips and smites with his hand.
Jalāluddīn (who uses incidentally the rather
double-edged analogy of a man possessed
by a peri<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>) relates the following anecdote
concerning Bāyazīd of Bistām, a celebrated
Persian saint who several times declared
in ecstatic frenzy that he was no other than
God.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> One of the spirits called collectively Jinn.</p>

</div>

<p>After coming to himself on one of these
occasions and learning what blasphemous
language he had uttered, Bāyazīd ordered
his disciples to stab him with their knives
if he should offend again. Let me quote
the sequel, from Mr. Whinfield’s abridged
translation of the <cite>Masnavī</cite> (p. 196):</p>

<p>The life of Abu ’l-Hasan Khurqānī, another
Persian Sūfī who died in 1033 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>,
gives us a complete picture of the Oriental
pantheist, and exhibits the mingled arrogance
and sublimity of the character as
clearly as could be desired. Since the
original text covers fifty pages, I can translate
only a small portion of it here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Once the Sheykh said, ‘This night
a great many persons (he mentioned the
exact number) have been wounded by
brigands in such-and-such a desert.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span>
On making inquiry, they found that
his statement was perfectly true.
Strange to relate, on the same night
his son’s head was cut off and laid upon
the threshold of his house, yet he knew
nothing of it. His wife, who disbelieved
in him, cried, ‘What think you of a
man who can tell things which happen
many leagues away, but does not know
that his own son’s head has been cut
off and is lying at his very door?’
‘Yes,’ the Sheykh answered, ‘when I
saw that, the veil had been lifted, but
when my son was killed, it had been let
down again.’”</p>

<p>“One day Abu ’l-Hasan Khurqānī
clenched his fist and extended the little
finger and said, ‘Here is the <i>qibla</i>,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> if any
one desires to become a Sūfī.’ These
words were reported to the Grand
Sheykh, who, deeming the co-existence
of two <i>qiblas</i> an insult to the divine
Unity, exclaimed, ‘Since a second <i>qibla</i>
has appeared, I will cancel the former
one.’ After that, no pilgrims were able to
reach Mecca. Some perished on the way,
others fell into the hands of robbers,
or were prevented by various causes
from accomplishing their journey. Next
year a certain dervish said to the Grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>
Sheykh, ‘What sense is there in keeping
the folk away from the House of God?’
Thereupon the Grand Sheykh made a
sign, and the road became open once
more. The dervish asked, ‘Whose
fault is it that all these people have
perished?’ The Grand Sheykh replied,
‘When elephants jostle each other,
who cares if a few wretched birds are
crushed to death?’”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> The <i>qibla</i> is the point to which Moslems turn their faces
when praying, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> the Kaʿba.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some persons who were setting
forth on a journey begged Khurqānī
to teach them a prayer that would keep
them safe from the perils of the road.
He said, ‘If any misfortune should
befall you, mention my name.’ This
answer was not agreeable to them;
they set off, however, and while travelling
were attacked by brigands. One
of the party mentioned the saint’s
name and immediately became invisible,
to the great astonishment of the brigands,
who could not find either his
camel or his bales of merchandise;
the others lost all their clothes and
goods. On returning home, they asked
the Sheykh to explain the mystery.
‘We all invoked God,’ they said, ‘and
without success; but the one man who
invoked you vanished from before the
eyes of the robbers.’ ‘You invoke
God formally,’ said the Sheykh, ‘whereas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span>
I invoke Him really. Hence, if you
invoke me and I then invoke God on
your behalf, your prayers are granted;
but it is useless for you to invoke God
formally and by rote.’”</p>

<p>“One night, while he was praying,
he heard a voice cry, ‘Ha! Abu
’l-Hasan! Dost thou wish Me to tell
the people what I know of thee, that
they may stone thee to death?’ ‘O
Lord God,’ he replied, ‘dost Thou wish
me to tell the people what I know of
Thy mercy and what I perceive of Thy
grace, that none of them may ever
again bow to Thee in prayer?’ The
voice answered, ‘Keep thy secret, and
I will keep Mine.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘O God, do not send to
me the Angel of Death, for I will not
give up my soul to him. How should
I restore it to him, from whom I did
not receive it? I received my soul
from Thee, and I will not give it up to
any one but Thee.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘After I shall have passed
away, the Angel of Death will come to
one of my descendants and set about
taking his soul, and will deal hardly
with him. Then will I raise my hands
from the tomb and shed the grace of
God upon his lips.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘If I bade the empyrean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span>
move, it would obey, and if I told the
sun to stop, it would cease from rolling
on its course.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘I am not a devotee nor
an ascetic nor a theologian nor a Sūfī.
O God, Thou art One, and through Thy
Oneness I am One.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘The skull of my head is
the empyrean, and my feet are under
the earth, and my two hands are East
and West.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘If any one does not
believe that I shall stand up at the
Resurrection and that he shall not
enter Paradise until I lead him forward,
let him not come here to salute
me.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Since God brought me
forth from myself, Paradise is in quest
of me and Hell is in fear of me; and
if Paradise and Hell were to pass by
this place where I am, both would
become annihilated in me, together with
all the people whom they contain.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘I was lying on my back,
asleep. From a corner of the Throne
of God something trickled into my
mouth, and I felt a sweetness in my
inward being.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘If a few drops of that
which is under the skin of a saint
should come forth between his lips,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span>
all the creatures of heaven and earth
would fall into panic.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Through prayer the saints
are able to stop the fish from swimming
in the sea and to make the earth
tremble, so that people think it is an
earthquake.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘If the love of God in
the hearts of His friends were made
manifest, it would fill the world with
flood and fire.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘He that lives with God
hath seen all things visible, and heard
all things audible, and done all that is
to be done, and known all that is to
be known.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘All things are contained
in me, but there is no room for myself
in me.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Miracles are only the
first of the thousand stages of the Way
to God.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Do not seek until thou
art sought, for when thou findest that
which thou seekest, it will resemble
thee.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Thou must daily die a
thousand deaths and come to life again,
that thou mayst win the life immortal.’”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘When thou givest to
God thy nothingness, He gives to thee
His All.’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span></p>

<p class="sp1">It would be an almost endless task to
enumerate and exemplify the different classes
of miracles which are related in the lives
of the Mohammedan saints&mdash;for instance,
walking on water, flying in the air (with or
without a passenger), rain-making, appearing
in various places at the same time,
healing by the breath, bringing the dead
to life, knowledge and prediction of future
events, thought-reading, telekinesis, paralysing
or beheading an obnoxious person by
a word or gesture, conversing with animals
or plants, turning earth into gold or precious
stones, producing food and drink, etc. To
the Moslem, who has no sense of natural
law, all these ‘violations of custom,’ as he
calls them, seem equally credible. We, on
the other hand, feel ourselves obliged to
distinguish phenomena which we regard as
irrational and impossible from those for
which we can find some sort of ‘natural’
explanation. Modern theories of psychical
influence, faith-healing, telepathy, veridical
hallucination, hypnotic suggestion and the
like, have thrown open to us a wide avenue
of approach to this dark continent in the
Eastern mind. I will not, however, pursue
the subject far at present, full of interest
as it is. In the higher Sūfī teaching the
miraculous powers of the saints play a more
or less insignificant part, and the excessive
importance which they assume in the organised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span>
mysticism of the Dervish Orders is one
of the clearest marks of its degeneracy.</p>

<p>The following passage, which I have
slightly modified, gives a fair summary of
the hypnotic process through which a dervish
attains to union with God:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The disciple must, mystically,
always bear his Murshid (spiritual
director) in mind, and become mentally
absorbed in him through a constant
meditation and contemplation of him.
The teacher must be his shield against
all evil thoughts. The spirit of the
teacher follows him in all his efforts, and
accompanies him wherever he may be,
quite as a guardian spirit. To such a
degree is this carried that he sees the
master in all men and in all things, just
as a willing subject is under the influence
of the magnetiser. This condition is
called ‘self-annihilation’ in the Murshid
or Sheykh. The latter finds, in his own
visionary dreams, the degree which the
disciple has reached, and whether or
not his spirit has become bound to his
own.</p>

<p>“At this stage the Sheykh passes him
over to the spiritual influence of the
long-deceased Pīr or original founder of
the Order, and he sees the latter only by
the spiritual aid of the Sheykh. This is
called ‘self-annihilation’ in the Pīr. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span>
now becomes so much a part of the Pīr as
to possess all his spiritual powers.</p>

<p>“The third grade leads him, also
through the spiritual aid of the Sheykh,
up to the Prophet himself, whom he now
sees in all things. This state is called
‘self-annihilation’ in the Prophet.</p>

<p>“The fourth degree leads him even
to God. He becomes united with the
Deity and sees Him in all things.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

</div>

<p>An excellent concrete illustration of the
process here described will be found in the
well-known case of Tawakkul Beg, who
passed through all these experiences under
the control of Mollā-Shāh. His account is
too long to quote in full; moreover, it has
recently been translated by Professor D. B.
Macdonald in his <cite>Religious Life and Attitude
in Islam</cite> (pp. 197 ff.). I copy from this
version one paragraph describing the first of
the four stages mentioned above.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Thereupon he made me sit before
him, my senses being as though intoxicated,
and ordered me to reproduce my
own image within myself; and, after
having bandaged my eyes, he asked me
to concentrate all my mental faculties
on my heart. I obeyed, and in an
instant, by the divine favour and by the
spiritual assistance of the Sheykh, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>
heart opened. I saw, then, that there
was something like an overturned cup
within me. This having been set upright,
a sensation of unbounded happiness
filled my being. I said to the
master, ‘This cell where I am seated
before you&mdash;I see a faithful reproduction
of it within me, and it appears
to me as though another Tawakkul Beg
were seated before another Mollā-Shāh.’
He replied, ‘Very good! the first apparition
which appears to thee is the
image of the master.’ He then ordered
me to uncover my eyes; and I saw him,
with the physical organ of vision, seated
before me. He then made me bind
my eyes again, and I perceived him
with my spiritual sight, seated similarly
before me. Full of astonishment, I
cried out, ‘O Master! whether I look
with my physical organs or with my
spiritual sight, always it is you that I
see!’”</p>

he was falling asleep. When I first
entered into companionship with him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span>
I happened one day to be seated before
him in the congregational mosque. According
to his custom, he fell into a
trance. I supposed that he was going
to sleep, and I said to him, ‘If you
desire to rest for a short time, you will
not seem to me to be far off.’ He
smiled and said, ‘Apparently you do
not believe that this is something
different from sleep.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The following anecdote presents greater
difficulties:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mawlānā Nizāmuddīn Khāmūsh
relates that one day his master, ʿAlāʾuddīn
ʿAttār, started to visit the tomb
of the celebrated saint Mohammed ibn
ʿAlī Hakīm, at Tirmidh. ‘I did not
accompany him,’ said Nizāmuddīn,
‘but stayed at home, and by concentrating
my mind (<i>tawajjuh</i>) I succeeded
in bringing the spirituality of the saint
before me, so that when the master
arrived at the tomb he found it empty.
He must have known the cause, for on
his return he set to work in order to
bring me under his control. I, too,
concentrated my mind, but I found
myself like a dove and the master like a
hawk flying in chase of me. Wherever
I turned, he was always close behind.
At last, despairing of escape, I took
refuge with the spirituality of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span>
Prophet (on whom be peace) and
became effaced in its infinite radiance.
The master could not exercise any
further control. He fell ill in consequence
of his chagrin, and no one except
myself knew the reason.’”</p>
</div>

<p>ʿAlāʾuddīn’s son, Khwāja Hasan ʿAttār,
possessed such powers of ‘control’ that he
could at will throw any one into the state
of trance and cause them to experience
the ‘passing-away’ (<i>fanā</i>) to which some
mystics attain only on rare occasions and
after prolonged self-mortification. It is related
that the disciples and visitors who
were admitted to the honour of kissing his
hand always fell unconscious to the ground.</p>

<p>Certain saints are believed to have the
power of assuming whatever shape they
please. One of the most famous was Abū
ʿAbdallah of Mosul, better known by the
name of Qadīb al-Bān. One day the Cadi
of Mosul, who regarded him as a detestable
heretic, saw him in a street of the town,
approaching from the opposite direction.
He resolved to seize him and lay a charge
against him before the governor, in order
that he might be punished. All at once he
perceived that Qadīb al-Bān had taken the
form of a Kurd; and as the saint advanced
towards him, his appearance changed again,
this time into an Arab of the desert. Finally,
on coming still nearer, he assumed the guise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span>
and dress of a doctor of theology, and cried,
“O Cadi! which Qadīb al-Bān will you hale
before the governor and punish?” The
Cadi repented of his hostility and became
one of the saint’s disciples.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me give two alleged
instances of ‘the obedience of inanimate
objects,’ <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> telekinesis:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whilst Dhu ’l-Nūn was conversing
on this topic with some friends, he
said, ‘Here is a sofa. It will move
round the room, if I tell it to do so.’
No sooner had he uttered the word
‘move’ than the sofa made a circuit
of the room and returned to its place.
One of the spectators, a young man,
burst into tears and gave up the ghost.
They laid him on that sofa and washed
him for burial.”</p>

<p>“Avicenna paid a visit to Abu
’l-Hasan Khurqānī and immediately
plunged into a long and abstruse discussion.
After a time the saint, who
was an illiterate person, felt tired, so
he got up and said, ‘Excuse me; I
must go and mend the garden wall’;
and off he went, taking a hatchet with
him. As soon as he had climbed on to
the top of the wall, the hatchet dropped
from his hand. Avicenna ran to pick
it up, but before he reached it the
hatchet rose of itself and came back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span>
into the saint’s hand. Avicenna lost
all his self-command, and the enthusiastic
belief in Sūfism which then took
possession of him continued until, at a
later period of his life, he abandoned
mysticism for philosophy.”</p>
</div>

<p class="sp1">I am well aware that in this chapter scanty
justice has been done to a great subject.
The historian of Sūfism must acknowledge,
however deeply he may deplore, the fundamental
position occupied by the doctrine
of saintship and the tremendous influence
which it has exerted in its practical results&mdash;grovelling
submission to the authority of
an ecstatic class of men, dependence on
their favour, pilgrimage to their shrines,
adoration of their relics, devotion of every
mental and spiritual faculty to their service.
It may be dangerous to worship God by
one’s own inner light, but it is far more
deadly to seek Him by the inner light of
another. Vicarious holiness has no compensations.
This truth is expressed by the
mystical writers in many an eloquent passage,
but I will content myself with quoting a
few lines from the life of ʿAlāʾuddīn ʿAttār,
the same saint who, as we have seen, vainly
tried to hypnotise his pupil in revenge for
a disrespectful trick which the latter had
played on him. His biographer relates that
he said, “It is more right and worthy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span>
dwell beside God than to dwell beside God’s
creatures,” and that the following verse
was often on his blessed tongue:</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="smcap">No</span> one can approach the subject of this
chapter&mdash;the state of the mystic who has
reached his journey’s end&mdash;without feeling
that all symbolical descriptions of union
with God and theories concerning its nature
are little better than leaps in the dark.
How shall we form any conception of that
which is declared to be ineffable by those
who have actually experienced it? I can
only reply that the same difficulty confronts
us in dealing with all mystical phenomena,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span>
though it appears less formidable at lower
levels, and that the poet’s counsel of silence
has not prevented him from interpreting
the deepest mysteries of Sūfism with unrivalled
insight and power.</p>

<p>Whatever terms may be used to describe
it, the unitive state is the culmination of
the simplifying process by which the soul
is gradually isolated from all that is foreign
to itself, from all that is not God. Unlike
Nirvāṇa, which is merely the cessation of
individuality, <i>fanā</i>, the passing-away of the
Sūfī from his phenomenal existence, involves
<i>baqā</i>, the continuance of his real existence.
He who dies to self lives in God, and
<i>fanā</i>, the consummation of this death, marks
the attainment of <i>baqā</i>, or union with the
divine life. Deification, in short, is the
Moslem mystic’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima Thule</i>.</p>

<p>In the early part of the tenth century
Husayn ibn Mansūr, known to fame as
al-Hallāj (the wool-carder), was barbarously
done to death at Baghdād. His execution
seems to have been dictated by political
motives, but with these we are not concerned.
Amongst the crowd assembled round the
scaffold, a few, perhaps, believed him to
be what he said he was; the rest witnessed
with exultation or stern approval the punishment
of a blasphemous heretic. He had
uttered in two words a sentence which
Islam has, on the whole, forgiven but has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span>
never forgotten: “<i>Ana ’l-Haqq</i>”&mdash;“I am
God.”</p>

<p>The recently published researches of M.
Louis Massignon<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> make it possible, for the
first time, to indicate the meaning which
Hallāj himself attached to this celebrated
formula, and to assert definitely that it
does not agree with the more orthodox
interpretations offered at a later epoch by
Sūfīs belonging to various schools. According
to Hallāj, man is essentially divine.
God created Adam in His own image. He
projected from Himself that image of His
eternal love, that He might behold Himself
as in a mirror. Hence He bade the angels
worship Adam (Kor. <span class="bold">2.</span> 32), in whom, as in
Jesus, He became incarnate.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Since the ‘humanity’ (<i>nāsūt</i>) of God
comprises the whole bodily and spiritual
nature of man, the ‘divinity’ (<i>lāhūt</i>) of
God cannot unite with that nature except
by means of an incarnation or, to adopt the
term employed by Massignon, an infusion
(<i>hulūl</i>) of the divine Spirit, such as takes
place when the human spirit enters the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> Massignon appears to be right in identifying the Divine
Spirit with the Active Reason (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intellectus agens</i>), which,
according to Alexander of Aphrodisias, is not a part or faculty
of our soul, but comes to us from without. See Inge,
<cite>Christian Mysticism</cite>, pp. 360, 361. The doctrine of Hallāj
may be compared with that of Tauler, Ruysbroeck, and
others concerning the birth of God in the soul.</p>

</div>

<p>This doctrine of personal deification, in
the peculiar form which was impressed
upon it by Hallāj, is obviously akin to the
central doctrine of Christianity, and therefore,
from the Moslem standpoint, a heresy
of the worst kind. It survived unadulterated
only amongst his immediate followers.
The Hulūlīs, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> those who believe in incarnation,
are repudiated by Sūfīs in general quite
as vehemently as by orthodox Moslems.
But while the former have unhesitatingly
condemned the doctrine of <i>hulūl</i>, they have
also done their best to clear Hallāj from
the suspicion of having taught it. Three
main lines of defence are followed: (1)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span>
Hallāj did not sin against the Truth, but he
was justly punished in so far as he committed
a grave offence against the Law.
He “betrayed the secret of his Lord” by
proclaiming to all and sundry the supreme
mystery which ought to be reserved for
the elect. (2) Hallāj spoke under the intoxicating
influence of ecstasy. He imagined
himself to be united with the divine
essence, when in fact he was only united
with one of the divine attributes. (3) Hallāj
meant to declare that there is no essential
difference or separation between God and
His creatures, inasmuch as the divine unity
includes all being. A man who has entirely
passed away from his phenomenal self exists
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quâ</i> his real self, which is God.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In that glory is no ‘I’ or ‘We’ or ‘Thou.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘I,’ ‘We,’ ‘Thou,’ and ‘He’ are all one thing.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was not Hallāj who cried “<i>Ana ’l-Haqq</i>,”
but God Himself, speaking, as it
were, by the mouth of the selfless Hallāj,
just as He spoke to Moses through the
medium of the burning bush (Kor. <span class="bold">20.</span> 8-14).</p>

<p>The last explanation, which converts
<i>Ana ’l-Haqq</i> into an impersonal monistic
axiom, is accepted by most Sūfīs as representing
the true Hallājian teaching. In
a magnificent ode Jalāluddīn Rūmī describes
how the One Light shines in myriad
forms through the whole universe, and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span>
the One Essence, remaining ever the same,
clothes itself from age to age in the prophets
and saints who are its witnesses to mankind.</p>

<p>Although in Western and Central Asia&mdash;where
the Persian kings were regarded
by their subjects as gods, and where the
doctrines of incarnation, anthropomorphism,
and metempsychosis are indigenous&mdash;the
idea of the God-man was neither so unfamiliar
nor unnatural as to shock the
public conscience very profoundly, Hallāj
had formulated that idea in such a way that
no mysticism calling itself Mohammedan
could tolerate, much less adopt it. To
assert that the divine and human natures
may be interfused and commingled,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> would
have been to deny the principle of unity
on which Islam is based. The subsequent
history of Sūfism shows how deification
was identified with unification. The antithesis&mdash;God,
Man&mdash;melted away in the
pantheistic theory which has been explained
above.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> There is no real existence apart
from God. Man is an emanation or a reflexion
or a mode of Absolute Being. What
he thinks of as individuality is in truth not-being;
it cannot be separated or united,
for it does not exist. Man <em>is</em> God, yet with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span>
a difference. According to Ibn al-ʿArabī,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
the eternal and the phenomenal are two
complementary aspects of the One, each
of which is necessary to the other. The
creatures are the external manifestation of
the Creator, and Man is God’s consciousness
(<i>sirr</i>) as revealed in creation. But since
Man, owing to the limitations of his mind,
cannot think all objects of thought simultaneously,
and therefore expresses only a
part of the divine consciousness, he is not
entitled to say <i>Ana ’l-Haqq</i>, “I am God.”
He is <em>a</em> reality, but not <em>the</em> Reality. We
shall see that other Sūfīs&mdash;Jalāluddīn
Rūmī, for example&mdash;in their ecstatic moments,
at any rate, ignore this rather subtle
distinction.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> <i>Hulūl</i> was not understood in this sense by Hallāj
(Massignon, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="work cited">op. cit.</abbr></i>, p. 199), though the verses quoted on
<a href="#Page_151">p. 151</a> readily suggest such an interpretation. Hallāj, I
think, would have agreed with Eckhart (who said, “The
word <em>I am</em> none can truly speak but God alone”) that
the personality in which the Eternal is immanent has itself
a part in eternity (Inge, <cite>Christian Mysticism</cite>, p. 149, note).</p>

<p>The statement that in realising the nonentity
of his individual self the Sūfī realises
his essential oneness with God, sums up the
Mohammedan theory of deification in terms
with which my readers are now familiar.
I will endeavour to show what more precise
meaning may be assigned to it, partly in
my own words and partly by means of
illustrative extracts from various authors.</p>

<p>Several aspects of <i>fanā</i> have already been
distinguished.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The highest of these&mdash;the
passing-away in the divine essence&mdash;is fully
described by Niffarī, who employs instead
of fanā and fānī (self-naughted) the terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span>
<i>waqfat</i>, signifying cessation from search, and
<i>wāqif</i>, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> one who desists from seeking and
passes away in the Object Sought. Here are
some of the chief points that occur in the
text and commentary.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> See <a href="#Page_60">pp. 60, 61</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Waqfat</i> is luminous: it expels the dark
thoughts of ‘otherness,’ just as light banishes
darkness; it changes the phenomenal values
of all existent things into their real and
eternal values.</p>

<p>Hence the <i>wāqif</i> transcends time and
place. “He enters every house and it
contains him not; he drinks from every
well but is not satisfied; then he reaches
Me, and I am his home, and his abode is
with Me”&mdash;that is to say, he comprehends
all the divine attributes and embraces all
mystical experiences. He is not satisfied
with the names (attributes), but seeks the
Named. He contemplates the essence of
God and finds it identical with his own.
He does not pray. Prayer is from man to
God, but in <i>waqfat</i> there is nothing but God.</p>

<p>The <i>wāqif</i> leaves not a rack behind him,
nor any heir except God. When even the
phenomenon of <i>waqfat</i> has disappeared from
his consciousness, he becomes the very
Light. Then his praise of God proceeds
from God, and his knowledge is God’s
knowledge, who beholds Himself alone as
He was in the beginning.</p>

<p>We need not expect to discover how this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p. 157]</span>
essentialisation, substitution, or transmutation
is effected. It is the grand paradox of
Sūfism&mdash;the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnum Opus</i> wrought somehow
<em>in</em> created man by a Being whose nature is
eternally devoid of the least taint of creatureliness.
As I have remarked above, the change,
however it may be conceived, does not involve
infusion of the divine essence (<i>hulūl</i>)
or identification of the divine and human
natures (<i>ittihād</i>). Both these doctrines are
generally condemned. Abū Nasr al-Sarrāj
criticises them in two passages of his <cite>Kitāb
al-Lumaʿ</cite>, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some mystics of Baghdād have
erred in their doctrine that when they
pass away from their qualities they
enter into the qualities of God. This
leads to incarnation (<i>hulūl</i>) or to the
Christian belief concerning Jesus. The
doctrine in question has been attributed
to some of the ancients, but its true
meaning is this, that when a man goes
forth from his own qualities and enters
into the qualities of God, he goes forth
from his own will and enters into the
will of God, knowing that his will is
given to him by God and that by virtue
of this gift he is severed from regarding
himself, so that he becomes entirely
devoted to God; and this is one of the
stages of Unitarians. Those who have
erred in this doctrine have failed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span>
observe that the qualities of God are
not God. To make God identical with
His qualities is to be guilty of infidelity,
because God does not descend into the
heart, but that which descends into
the heart is faith in God and belief in
His unity and reverence for the thought
of Him.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the second passage he makes use of
a similar argument in order to refute the
doctrine of <i>ittihād</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some have abstained from food
and drink, fancying that when a man’s
body is weakened it is possible that he
may lose his humanity and be invested
with the attributes of divinity. The
ignorant persons who hold this erroneous
doctrine cannot distinguish between
humanity and the inborn qualities of
humanity. Humanity does not depart
from man any more than blackness
departs from that which is black or
whiteness from that which is white,
but the inborn qualities of humanity
are changed and transmuted by the
all-powerful radiance that is shed upon
them from the divine Realities. The
attributes of humanity are not the
essence of humanity. Those who inculcate
the doctrine of <i>fanā</i> mean the
passing-away of regarding one’s own
actions and works of devotion through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span>
the continuance of regarding God as
the doer of these actions on behalf of
His servant.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hujwīrī characterises as absurd the belief
that passing-away (<i>fanā</i>) signifies loss of
essence and destruction of corporeal substance,
and that ‘abiding’ (<i>baqā</i>) indicates
the indwelling of God in man. Real passing-away
from anything, he says, implies consciousness
of its imperfection and absence
of desire for it. Whoever passes away from
his own perishable will abides in the everlasting
will of God, but human attributes
cannot become divine attributes or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
versa</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The power of fire transforms to its
own quality anything that falls into it,
and surely the power of God’s will is
greater than that of fire; yet fire
affects only the quality of iron without
changing its substance, for iron can
never become fire.”</p>
</div>

<p>In another part of his work Hujwīrī
defines ‘union’ (<i>jamʿ</i>) as concentration of
thought upon the desired object. Thus
Majnūn, the Orlando Furioso of Islam,
concentrated his thoughts on Laylā, so that
he saw only her in the whole world, and all
created things assumed the form of Laylā
in his eyes. Some one came to the cell of
Bāyazīd and asked, “Is Bāyazīd here?”
He answered, “Is any one here but God?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>
The principle in all such cases, Hujwīrī
adds, is the same, namely:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That God divides the one substance
of His love and bestows a particle
thereof, as a peculiar gift, upon every
one of His friends in proportion to their
enravishment with Him; then he lets
down upon that particle the shrouds
of fleshliness and human nature and
temperament and spirit, in order that by
its powerful working it may transmute
to its own quality all the particles that
are attached to it, until the lover’s
clay is wholly converted into love and
all his acts and looks become so many
properties of love. This state is named
‘union’ alike by those who regard the
inward sense and the outward expression.”</p>
</div>

<p><a id="TN6">Then he quotes</a> these verses of Hallāj:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thy will be done, O my Lord and Master!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy will be done, O my purpose and meaning!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O essence of my being, O goal of my desire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O my speech and my hints and my gestures!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O all of my all, O my hearing and my sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O my whole and my element and my particles!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The enraptured Sūfī who has passed
beyond the illusion of subject and object
and broken through to the Oneness can either
deny that he is anything or affirm that he is
all things. As an example of ‘the negative
way,’ take the opening lines of an ode by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span>
Jalāluddīn which I have rendered into
verse, imitating the metrical form of the
Persian as closely as the genius of our
language will permit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lo, for I to myself am unknown, now in God’s name what must I do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I adore not the Cross nor the Crescent, I am not a Giaour nor a Jew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">East nor West, land nor sea is my home, I have kin nor with angel nor gnome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am wrought not of fire nor of foam, I am shaped not of dust nor of dew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was born not in China afar, not in Saqsīn and not in Bulghār;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not in India, where five rivers are, nor ʿIrāq nor Khorāsān I grew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not in this world nor that world I dwell, not in Paradise, neither in Hell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not from Eden and Rizwān I fell, not from Adam my lineage I drew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a place beyond uttermost Place, in a tract without shadow of trace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soul and body transcending I live in the soul of my Loved One anew!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following poem, also by Jalāluddīn,
expresses the positive aspect of the cosmic
consciousness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If there be any lover in the world, O Moslems, ’tis I.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Angels, Peris, Genies, and Mankind&mdash;’tis I.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What Jalāluddīn utters in a moment of
ecstatic vision Henry More describes as a
past experience:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How lovely” (he says), “how magnificent
a state is the soul of man in,
when the life of God inactuating her
shoots her along with Himself through
heaven and earth; makes her unite
with, and after a sort feel herself
animate, the whole world. He that is
here looks upon all things as One, and
on himself, if he can then mind himself,
as a part of the Whole.”</p>
</div>

<p>For some Sūfīs, absorption in the ecstasy
of <i>fanā</i> is the end of their pilgrimage.
Thenceforth no relation exists between them
and the world. Nothing of themselves is
left in them; as individuals, they are dead.
Immersed in Unity, they know neither law
nor religion nor any form of phenomenal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span>
being. But those God-intoxicated devotees
who never return to sobriety have fallen
short of the highest perfection. The full
circle of deification must comprehend both
the inward and outward aspects of Deity&mdash;the
One and the Many, the Truth and the
Law. It is not enough to escape from all
that is creaturely, without entering into the
eternal life of God the Creator as manifested
in His works. To abide in God (<i>baqā</i>)
after having passed-away from selfhood
(<i>fanā</i>) is the mark of the Perfect Man, who
not only journeys <em>to</em> God, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i> passes from
plurality to unity, but <em>in</em> and <em>with</em> God, <i><abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr></i>
continuing in the unitive state, he returns
with God to the phenomenal world from
which he set out, and manifests unity in
plurality. In this descent</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“He makes the Law his upper garment</div>

</div>

<div class="noindent">
<p>for he brings down and displays the Truth

words of a great Christian mystic:</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He goes <em>towards</em> God by inward
love, in eternal work, and he goes <em>in</em>
God by his fruitive inclination, in
eternal rest. And he dwells in God;
and yet he goes out towards created
things in a spirit of love towards all
things, in the virtues and in works of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span>
righteousness. And this is the most
exalted summit of the inner life.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> Ruysbroeck, quoted in E. Underhill’s <cite>Introduction to
Mysticism</cite>, p. 522.</p>

</div>

<p>ʿAfīfuddīn Tilimsānī, in his commentary on
Niffarī, describes four mystical journeys:</p>

<p>The <em>first</em> begins with gnosis and ends with
complete passing-away (<i>fanā</i>).</p>

<p>The <em>second</em> begins at the moment when
passing-away is succeeded by ‘abiding’
(<i>baqā</i>).</p>

<p>He who has attained to this station
journeys in the Real, by the Real, to the
Real, and he then is a reality (<i>haqq</i>).<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Thus
travelling onward, he arrives at the station
of the <i>Qutb</i>,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which is the station of Perfect
Manhood. He becomes the centre of the
spiritual universe, so that every point and
limit reached by individual human beings is
equally distant from his station, whether they
be near or far; since all stations revolve
round his, and in relation to the <i>Qutb</i> there is
no difference between nearness and farness.
To one who has gained this supreme position,
knowledge and gnosis and passing-away are
as rivers of his ocean, whereby he replenishes
whomsoever he will. He has the right to
guide others to God, and seeks permission
to do so from none but himself. Before
the gate of Apostleship was closed,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span>
have deserved the title of Apostle, but in
our day his due title is Director of Souls, and
he is a blessing to those who invoke his aid,
because he comprehends the innate capacities
of all mankind and, like a camel-driver,
speeds every one to his home.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> <i><abbr title="That is">I.e.</abbr></i> before the time of Mohammed, who is the Seal of
the Prophets.</p>

</div>

<p>In the <em>third</em> journey this Perfect Man
turns his attention to God’s creatures,
either as an Apostle or as a Spiritual Director
(Sheykh), and reveals himself to those who
would fain be released from their faculties,
to each according to his degree: to the
adherent of positive religion as a theologian;
to the contemplative, who has not yet
enjoyed full contemplation, as a gnostic;
to the gnostic as one who has entirely
passed-away from individuality (<i>wāqif</i>);
to the <i>wāqif</i> as a <i>Qutb</i>. He is the horizon
of every mystical station and transcends
the furthest range of experience known to
each grade of seekers.</p>

<p>The <em>fourth</em> journey is usually associated
with physical death. The Prophet was referring
to it when he cried on his deathbed, “I
choose the highest companions.” In this
journey, to judge from the obscure verses in
which ʿAfīfuddīn describes it, the Perfect
Man, having been invested with all the
divine attributes, becomes, so to speak, the
mirror which displays God to Himself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“When my Beloved appears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">With what eye do I see Him?</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span>
    <div class="verse indent4">With His eye, not with mine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">For none sees Him except Himself.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="smcap">Ibn al-ʿArabī.</span>)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The light in the soul, the eye by which it
sees, and the object of its vision, all are One.</p>


<p class="sp1">We have followed the Sūfī in his quest
of Reality to a point where language fails.
His progress will seldom be so smooth and
unbroken as it appears in these pages. The
proverbial headache after intoxication supplies
a parallel to the periods of intense
aridity and acute suffering that sometimes
fill the interval between lower and higher
states of ecstasy. Descriptions of this
experience&mdash;the Dark Night of the Soul,
as it is called by Christian authors&mdash;may
be found in almost any biography of Mohammedan
saints. Thus Jāmī relates in his
<cite>Nafahāt al-Uns</cite> that a certain dervish, a disciple
of the famous Shihābuddīn Suhrawardī,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Was endowed with a great ecstasy
in the contemplation of Unity and in the
station of passing-away (<i>fanā</i>). One
day he began to weep and lament.
On being asked by the Sheykh Shihābuddīn
what ailed him, he answered,
‘Lo, I am debarred by plurality from
the vision of Unity. I am rejected, and
my former state&mdash;I cannot find it!’
The Sheykh remarked that this was
the prelude to the station of ‘abiding’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span>
(<i>baqā</i>), and that his present state was
higher and more sublime than the
one which he was in before.”</p>
</div>

<p>Does personality survive in the ultimate
union with God? If personality means a conscious
existence distinct, though not separate,
from God, the majority of advanced Moslem
mystics say “No!” As the rain-drop
absorbed in the ocean is not annihilated but
ceases to exist individually, so the disembodied
soul becomes indistinguishable from
the universal Deity. It is true that when
Sūfī writers translate mystical union into
terms of love and marriage, they do not,
indeed they cannot, expunge the notion of
personality, but such metaphorical phrases
are not necessarily inconsistent with a pantheism
which excludes all difference. To
be united, here and now, with the World-Soul
is the utmost imaginable bliss for souls
that love each other on earth.</p>

  <div class="stanza">

</div>
</div>

<p>Strange as it may seem to our Western
egoism, the prospect of sharing in the general,
impersonal immortality of the human soul
kindles in the Sūfī an enthusiasm as deep
and triumphant as that of the most ardent
believer in a personal life continuing beyond
the grave. Jalāluddīn, after describing the
evolution of man in the material world
and anticipating his further growth in the
spiritual universe, utters a heartfelt prayer&mdash;for
what?&mdash;for self-annihilation in the ocean
of the Godhead.</p>

to the literature of experimental psychology. The authoress claims

original in character, they deal with those problems in this world and the
next which are of vital interest to all, and will make special appeal to
students of the psychology of different phases of consciousness.</p>

<p>The following changes have been made to the text as printed:</p>

<p>1. Footnotes have been placed immediately below the paragraph within
which they occur, and marked numerically.</p>

<p>2. A period has been removed following the subheading <i><a href="#Gnost">Gnosticism</a></i> (Page 14), for consistency with other subheadings.</p>

<p>3. <i>strenously</i> (Page 51) has been corrected to <i><a href="#TN2">strenuously</a></i>.</p>

<p>4. The missing word <i>I</i> has been inserted in the passage <i><a href="#TN2A">the next
world belongs to him towards whom I have brought it</a></i> (Page 78).</p>

<p>5. The name printed as Fitz Gerald (Page 97) has been rendered as
<a href="#TN3">FitzGerald</a> (the usual form for this writer).</p>

<p>6. A single close-quote mark has been inserted after <i><a href="#TN4">vouchsafed to him</a></i>
(Page 127).</p>

<p>7. <i>karāmat</i> (Page 129) has been changed to <i><a href="#TN5">karāmāt</a></i>.</p>

<p>8. The line beginning <i><a href="#TN6">Then he quotes</a></i> (Page 160) has had its
indentation reduced, as it is part of the main text and not (as
printed) part of the preceding quotation.</p>

<p>9. Index: The character ʿ has been added in the words <i><a href="#TN7.1">Abu ’l-Khayr
al-Aqtaʿ</a></i>, <i><a href="#TN7.2">ʿAlāʾuddīn</a></i>, <i><a href="#TN7.3">muʿjizat</a></i>, <i><a href="#TN7.4">Muʿtazilites</a></i>, and <i><a href="#TN7.5">Rābiʿa</a></i>.</p>

<p>10. Apparent inconsistencies in whether hyphens occur in the word pairs <i>well known</i>,
<i>passed away</i>, and <i>above mentioned</i> are judged to be due to differences in sense,
and no amendments have been made.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
